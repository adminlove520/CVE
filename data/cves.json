      "description": "FluxCP is a web-based Control Panel for rAthena servers written in PHP. A critical Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the FluxCP-based website template used by multiple rAthena/Ragnarok servers. State-changing POST endpoints accept browser-initiated requests that are authorized solely by the session cookie without per-request anti-CSRF tokens or robust Origin/Referer validation. An attacker who can lure a logged-in user to an attacker-controlled page can cause that user to perform sensitive actions without their intent. This vulnerability is fixed with commit e3f130c.",
