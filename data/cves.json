      "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in TechPowerUp GPU-Z 2.23.0. Affected is the function sub_140001880 in the library GPU-Z.sys of the component 0x8000645C IOCTL Handler. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
