      "description": "OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management application. Prior to version 8.0.0, in `portal/portal_payment.php`, the patient id used for the page is taken from the request (`$pid = $_REQUEST['pid'] ?? $pid` and `$pid = ($_REQUEST['hidden_patient_code'] ?? null) > 0 ? $_REQUEST['hidden_patient_code'] : $pid`) instead of being fixed to the authenticated portal user. The portal session already has a valid `$pid` for the logged-in patient. Overwriting it with user-supplied values and using it without authorization allows a portal user to view and interact with another patient's demographics, invoices, and payment history—horizontal privilege escalation and IDOR. Version 8.0.0 contains a fix for the issue.",

      "description": "A security flaw has been discovered in feiyuchuixue sz-boot-parent up to 1.3.2-beta. This affects an unknown part of the file /api/admin/common/download/templates of the component API. Performing a manipulation of the argument templateName results in path traversal. Remote exploitation of the attack is possible. The exploit has been released to the public and may be used for attacks. Upgrading to version 1.3.3-beta is able to mitigate this issue. The patch is named aefaabfd7527188bfba3c8c9eee17c316d094802. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The project was informed beforehand and acted very professional: \"We have implemented path validity checks on parameters for the template download interface (...)\"",

In some cases an attacker may be able to leverage this to bypass access controls based on IP addresses.\n\nThe documentation advises validating untrusted CIDR strings with the `cidrvalidate` function. However, this mitigation is optional and not enforced by default.
