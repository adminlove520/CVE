      "description": "Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. Prior to commit bf28c82dc9b1f630fa8e9106358771b20a0040f7, the API endpoint for creating a card update session during an upgrade flow was accessible to users with only organization member privileges. When the associated Stripe Checkout session is completed, the Stripe webhook updates the organization’s default payment method. Because no billing-specific authorization check is enforced, a regular (non-billing) member can change the organization’s payment method. This vulnerability affected the Zulip Cloud payment processing system, and has been patched as of commit bf28c82dc9b1f630fa8e9106358771b20a0040f7. Self-hosted deploys are no longer affected and no patch or upgrade is required for them.",

      "description": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache Camel LevelDB component.\n\nThe Camel-LevelDB DefaultLevelDBSerializer class deserializes data read from the LevelDB aggregation repository using java.io.ObjectInputStream without applying any ObjectInputFilter or class-loading restrictions. An attacker who can write to the LevelDB database files used by a Camel application can inject a crafted serialized Java object that, when deserialized during normal aggregation repository operations, results in arbitrary code execution in the context of the application.\nThis issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 before 4.10.8, from 4.14.0 before 4.14.5, from 4.15.0 before 4.18.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.0, which fixes the issue. For the 4.10.x LTS releases, users are recommended to upgrade to 4.10.9, while for 4.14.x LTS releases, users are recommended to upgrade to 4.14.5",
