      "description": "The WP Maps – Store Locator,Google Maps,OpenStreetMap,Mapbox,Listing,Directory & Filters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.6 via the fc_load_template function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .html files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .html file types can be uploaded and included.",
