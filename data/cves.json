Prior to version 0.2.5, there is a command injection vulnerability that allows authenticated users to inject stdio_config.command/args into MCP stdio settings, causing the server to execute subprocesses using these injected values.

Prior to version 0.2.5, after WeKnora enables the Agent service, it allows users to call the database query tool. Due to insufficient backend validation, an attacker can use prompt‑based bypass techniques to evade query restrictions and obtain sensitive information from the target server and database.
