      "description": "The Print Service component of Fiserv Originate Loans Peripherals (formerly Velocity Services) in unsupported version 2021.2.4 (build 4.7.3155.0011) uses deprecated .NET Remoting TCP channels that allow unsafe deserialization of untrusted data. When these services are exposed to an untrusted network in a client-managed deployment, an unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution. Version 2021.2.4 is no longer supported by Fiserv. Customers should upgrade to a currently supported release (2025.1 or later) and ensure that .NET Remoting service ports are not exposed beyond trusted network boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis CVE documents behavior observed in a client-hosted deployment running an unsupported legacy version of Originate Loans Peripherals with .NET Remoting ports exposed to an untrusted network. This is not a default or supported configuration. Customers running legacy versions should upgrade to a currently supported release and ensure .NET Remoting ports are restricted to trusted network segments. The finding does not apply to Fiserv-hosted environments.",
