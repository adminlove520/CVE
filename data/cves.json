      "description": "Astro is a web framework that includes an image proxy. In versions 5.13.4 and later before 5.13.10, the image proxy domain validation can be bypassed by using backslashes in the href parameter, allowing server-side requests to arbitrary URLs. This can lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF) and potentially cross-site scripting (XSS). This vulnerability exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2025-58179. Fixed in 5.13.10.",

      "description": "IPFire versions prior to 2.29 (Core Update 198) contain a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code through the IGNORE_ENTRY_REMARK parameter when adding a whitelisted host. When a whitelisted host is added, an HTTP POST request is sent to the Request-URI /cgi-bin/ids.cgi and the remark for the entry is provided in the IGNORE_ENTRY_REMARK parameter. The value of this parameter is stored and later rendered in the web interface without proper sanitization or encoding, allowing injected scripts to execute in the context of other users who view the affected whitelist entry.",
