      "description": "A weakness has been identified in Wavlink WL-NU516U1 20251208. Affected by this issue is the function sub_40785C of the file /cgi-bin/adm.cgi. This manipulation of the argument time_zone causes stack-based buffer overflow. The attack can be initiated remotely. The attack is considered to have high complexity. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be used for attacks. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
