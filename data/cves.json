      "description": "Scrapy versions up to 2.13.2 are vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to a flaw in its brotli decompression implementation. The protection mechanism against decompression bombs fails to mitigate the brotli variant, allowing remote servers to crash clients with less than 80GB of available memory. This occurs because brotli can achieve extremely high compression ratios for zero-filled data, leading to excessive memory consumption during decompression.",

      "description": "Nagios Fusion versions prior to R2.1 contain a vulnerability due to the application not requiring re-authentication or session rotation when a user has enabled two-factor authentication (2FA). As a result, an adversary who has obtained a valid session could continue using the active session after the target user enabled 2FA, potentially preventing the legitimate user from locking the attacker out and enabling persistent account takeover.",
