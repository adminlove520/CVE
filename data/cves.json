      "description": "A vulnerability was found in Netis WF-2404 1.1.124EN. It has been rated as problematic. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /еtc/passwd. The manipulation leads to use of weak hash. It is possible to launch the attack on the physical device. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
