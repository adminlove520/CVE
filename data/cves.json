Prior to versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a large HTTP content type, when logged can cause a stack overflow crashing Suricata. This issue has been patched in versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround for this issue involves limiting stream.reassembly.depth to less then half the stack size. Increasing the process stack size makes it less likely the bug will trigger.",
