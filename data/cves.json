      "description": "Appsmith is a platform to build admin panels, internal tools, and dashboards. In versions 1.94 and below, publicly accessible apps allow unauthenticated users to execute unpublished (edit-mode) actions by sending viewMode=false (or omitting it) to POST /api/v1/actions/execute. This bypasses the expected publish boundary where public viewers should only execute published actions, not edit-mode versions. An attack can result in sensitive data exposure, execution of edit‑mode queries and APIs, development data access, and the ability to trigger side effect behavior. This issue does not have a released fix at the time of publication.",

      "description": "Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). In version 1.4.0, the OTP handling logic has a flawed equality check that can be bypassed. When an OTP expires, the server returns None, and if an attacker omits the otp field from their POST request, the user-supplied OTP is also None, causing the comparison user_otp == otp to pass. This allows an attacker to bypass two-factor authentication entirely without ever providing a valid OTP. If administrative accounts are targeted, it could lead to compromise of sensitive HR data, manipulation of employee records, and further system-wide abuse. This issue has been fixed in version 1.5.0.",

      "description": "Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). Version 1.4.0 has Improper Access Control, allowing low-privileged employees to self-approve documents they have uploaded. The document-approval UI is intended to be restricted to administrator or high-privilege roles only; however, an insufficient server-side authorization check on the approval endpoint lets a standard employee modify the approval status of their own uploaded document. A successful exploitation allows users with only employee-level permissions to alter application state reserved for administrators. This undermines the integrity of HR processes (for example, acceptance of credentials, certifications, or supporting materials), and may enable submission of unvetted documents.
