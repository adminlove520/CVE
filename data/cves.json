      "description": "A time-of-create-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability lets recently deleted-then-recreated data sources be re-deleted without permission to do so.\n\nThis requires several very stringent conditions to be met:\n\n- The attacker must have admin access to the specific datasource prior to its first deletion.\n- Upon deletion, all steps within the attack must happen within the next 30 seconds and on the same pod of Grafana.\n- The attacker must delete the datasource, then someone must recreate it.\n- The new datasource must not have the attacker as an admin.\n- The new datasource must have the same UID as the prior datasource. These are randomised by default.\n- The datasource can now be re-deleted by the attacker.\n- Once 30 seconds are up, the attack is spent and cannot be repeated.\n- No datasource with any other UID can be attacked.",
