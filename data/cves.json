      "description": "MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) is an AI toolkit for health care imaging. In versions up to and including 1.5.0, the `pickle_operations` function in `monai/data/utils.py` automatically handles dictionary key-value pairs ending with a specific suffix and deserializes them using `pickle.loads()` . This function also lacks any security measures. The deserialization may lead to code execution. As of time of publication, no known fixed versions are available.",

      "description": "MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) is an AI toolkit for health care imaging. In versions up to and including 1.5.0, in `model_dict = torch.load(full_path, map_location=torch.device(device), weights_only=True)` in monai/bundle/scripts.py , `weights_only=True` is loaded securely. However, insecure loading methods still exist elsewhere in the project, such as when loading checkpoints. This is a common practice when users want to reduce training time and costs by loading pre-trained models downloaded from other platforms. Loading a checkpoint containing malicious content can trigger a deserialization vulnerability, leading to code execution. As of time of publication, no known fixed versions are available.",
