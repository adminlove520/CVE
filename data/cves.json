      "description": "GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 9.5.0 and prior to version 10.0.18, if a \"Mail servers\" authentication provider is configured to use an Oauth connection provided by the OauthIMAP plugin, anyone can connect to GLPI using a user name on which an Oauth authorization has already been established. Version 10.0.18 contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disable any \"Mail servers\" authentication provider configured to use an Oauth connection provided by the OauthIMAP plugin.",
