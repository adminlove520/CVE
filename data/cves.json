      "description": "A weakness has been identified in jishi node-sonos-http-api up to 3776f0ee2261c924c7b7204de121a38100a08ca7. Affected is the function Promise of the file lib/tts-providers/mac-os.js of the component TTS Provider. This manipulation of the argument phrase causes os command injection. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be used for attacks. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available. The project was informed of the problem early through an issue report but has not responded yet.",
