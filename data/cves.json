      "description": "Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. Prior to 4.12.0, a buffer over-read occurs in w_expression_match() when strlen() is called on str_test, because the corresponding buffer is not being properly NULL terminated during its allocation in OS_CleanMSG(). A compromised agent can cause a READ operation beyond the end of the allocated buffer (which may contain sensitive information) by sending a specially crafted message to the wazuh manager. An attacker who is able to craft and send an agent message to the wazuh manager can cause a buffer over-read and potentially access sensitive data. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.12.0.",

      "description": "IPFire versions prior to 2.29 (Core Update 198) contain multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities caused by a bug in the cleanhtml() function (/var/ipfire/header.pl) that fails to apply HTML-entity encoding to user input. When an authenticated user submits data to affected endpoints - for example, POST /cgi-bin/wakeonlan.cgi (CLIENT_COMMENT), /cgi-bin/dhcp.cgi (ADVOPT_DATA, FIX_REMARK, FIX_FILENAME, FIX_ROOTPATH), /cgi-bin/connscheduler.cgi (ACTION_COMMENT), /cgi-bin/dnsforward.cgi (REMARK), /cgi-bin/vpnmain.cgi (REMARK), or /cgi-bin/dns.cgi (REMARK) - the application calls escape() and HTML::Entities::encode_entities() but never assigns the sanitized result back to the output variable. The original unsanitized value is therefore stored and later rendered in the web interface without proper sanitation or encoding, allowing injected scripts to execute in the context of other users who view the affected entries.",
