      "description": "A vulnerability has been found in fosrl Pangolin up to 1.15.4-s.3. This affects the function verifyRoleAccess/verifyApiKeyRoleAccess of the component Role Handler. The manipulation leads to improper access controls. Remote exploitation of the attack is possible. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 1.15.4-s.4 mitigates this issue. The identifier of the patch is 5e37c4e85fae68e756be5019a28ca903b161fdd5. Upgrading the affected component is advised.",

      "description": "Mailpit is an email testing tool and API for developers. Prior to version 1.29.2, the Link Check API (/api/v1/message/{ID}/link-check) is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The server performs HTTP HEAD requests to every URL found in an email without validating target hosts or filtering private/internal IP addresses. The response returns status codes and status text per link, making this a non-blind SSRF. In the default configuration (no authentication on SMTP or API), this is fully exploitable remotely with zero user interaction. This is the same class of vulnerability that was fixed in the HTML Check API (CVE-2026-23845 / GHSA-6jxm-fv7w-rw5j) and the screenshot proxy (CVE-2026-21859 / GHSA-8v65-47jx-7mfr), but the Link Check code path was not included in either fix. Version 1.29.2 fixes this vulnerability.",

      "description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 8.6.3 and 9.1.1-alpha.4, an unauthenticated attacker can forge a Google authentication token with `alg: \"none\"` to log in as any user linked to a Google account, without knowing their credentials. All deployments with Google authentication enabled are affected. The fix in versions 8.6.3 and 9.1.1-alpha.4 hardcodes the expected `RS256` algorithm instead of trusting the JWT header, and replaces the Google adapter's custom key fetcher with `jwks-rsa` which rejects unknown key IDs. As a workaround, dsable Google authentication until upgrading is possible.",
