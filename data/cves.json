      "description": "A vulnerability was found in IROAD Dash Cam FX2 up to 20250308. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /etc/passwd of the component Password Hash Handler. The manipulation leads to password hash with insufficient computational effort. Access to the local network is required for this attack. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
