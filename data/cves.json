      "description": "A vulnerability in huggingface/text-generation-inference version 3.3.6 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit unbounded external image fetching during input validation in VLM mode. The issue arises when the router scans inputs for Markdown image links and performs a blocking HTTP GET request, reading the entire response body into memory and cloning it before decoding. This behavior can lead to resource exhaustion, including network bandwidth saturation, memory inflation, and CPU overutilization. The vulnerability is triggered even if the request is later rejected for exceeding token limits. The default deployment configuration, which lacks memory usage limits and authentication, exacerbates the impact, potentially crashing the host machine. The issue is resolved in version 3.3.7.",

      "description": "A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists in the '/reinstall_extension' endpoint of the parisneo/lollms-webui application, specifically within the `name` parameter of the `@router.post(\"/reinstall_extension\")` route. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject a malicious `name` parameter, leading to the server loading and executing arbitrary Python files from the upload directory for discussions. This issue arises due to the concatenation of `data.name` directly with `lollmsElfServer.lollms_paths.extensions_zoo_path` and its use as an argument for `ExtensionBuilder().build_extension()`. The server's handling of the `__init__.py` file in arbitrary locations, facilitated by `importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader`, enables the execution of arbitrary code, such as command execution or creating a reverse-shell connection. This vulnerability affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui and can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the application is exposed to an external endpoint or the UI, especially when bound to `0.0.0.0` or in `headless mode`. No user interaction is required for exploitation.",
