A command injection vulnerability exists in SonarQube GitHub Action in version 4.0.0 to before version 6.0.0 when workflows pass user-controlled input to the args parameter on Windows runners without proper validation. This vulnerability bypasses a previous security fix and allows arbitrary command execution, potentially leading to exposure of sensitive environment variables and compromise of the runner environment. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 6.0.0. Users should upgrade to this version or later.",
