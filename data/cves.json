      "description": "A vulnerability was found in coldfunction qCUDA up to db0085400c2f2011eed46fbc04fdc0873141688e. It has been rated as problematic. Affected by this issue is the function qcow_make_empty of the file qCUDA/qcu-device/block/qcow.c. The manipulation of the argument s->l1_size leads to integer overflow. The attack needs to be approached locally. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available.",
