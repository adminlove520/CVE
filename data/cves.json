      "description": "In version 0.7.8 of danny-avila/librechat, improper authorization controls in the conversation sharing feature allow unauthorized access to other users' conversations if the conversation ID is known. Although UUIDv4 conversation IDs are generated server-side and are difficult to brute force, they can be obtained from less-protected sources such as server-side access logs, browser history, or screenshots. The vulnerability permits a logged-in user to gain read-only access to another user's conversations by exploiting the `/api/share/conversationID` endpoint, which lacks authorization checks. This issue is resolved in version v0.7.9-rc1.",

      "description": "Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Due to an error in command parsing, versions prior to 1.0.105 were vulnerable to a bypass of the Claude Code confirmation prompt to trigger execution of an untrusted command. Reliably exploiting this requires the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. Users on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to version 1.0.105 or the latest version.",
