      "description": "text-generation-webui is an open-source web interface for running Large Language Models. In versions through 3.13, a Local File Inclusion vulnerability exists in the character picture upload feature. An attacker can upload a text file containing a symbolic link to an arbitrary file path. When the application processes the upload, it follows the symbolic link and serves the contents of the targeted file through the web interface. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to read sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing system configurations, credentials, and other confidential information. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.14. No known workarounds exist.",

      "description": "A vulnerability was identified in Tomofun Furbo 360 and Furbo Mini. Affected by this issue is the function upload_file_to_s3 of the file collect_logs.sh of the component HTTP Traffic Handler. The manipulation leads to improper certificate validation. The attack may be initiated remotely. The attack is considered to have high complexity. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The firmware versions determined to be affected are Furbo 360 up to FB0035_FW_036 and Furbo Mini up to MC0020_FW_074. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
