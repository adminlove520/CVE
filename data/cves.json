      "description": "The Woffice CRM theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.21. This is due to a misconfiguration of excluded roles during registration. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register with an Administrator role if a custom login form is being used. This can be combined with CVE-2025-2797 to bypass the user approval process if an Administrator can be tricked into taking an action such as clicking a link.",
