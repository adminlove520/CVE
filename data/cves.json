      "description": "The Zombify plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.5. This is due to insufficient input validation in the zf_get_file_by_url function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files like /etc/passwd, via a forged request. It's worth noting that successfully exploiting this vulnerability relies on a race condition as the file generated will be deleted immediately.",
