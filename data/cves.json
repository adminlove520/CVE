      "description": "z80pack is a mature emulator of multiple platforms with 8080 and Z80 CPU. In version 1.38 and prior, the `makefile-ubuntu.yml` workflow file uses `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to upload the `z80pack-ubuntu` artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated `.git/config` file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the Github API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository. This issue has been fixed in commit bd95916.",

      "description": "Fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. In versions 5.0.0 to 5.3.0, applications that specify different validation strategies for different content types have a possibility to bypass validation by providing a _slightly altered_ content type such as with different casing or altered whitespacing before `;`. This was patched in v5.3.1, but the initial patch did not cover all problems. This has been fully patched in v5.3.2. A workaround involves not specifying individual content types in the schema.",
