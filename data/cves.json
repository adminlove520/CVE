NOTE: the Supplier's position is that the instance of CWE-1394 is not a vulnerability because customers \"are supposed to enable\" a non-default option that eliminates the weakness. However, that non-default option can disrupt functionality as shown in the \"Managing FortiGates with private data encryption\" document, and is therefore intentionally not a default option.",
