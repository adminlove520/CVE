      "description": "jsrsasign v11.1.0 was discovered to contain weak encryption. NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party who believes that CVE IDs can be assigned for key lengths in specific applications that use a library, and should not be assigned to the default key lengths in a library. This dispute is subject to review under CNA rules 4.1.4, 4.1.14, and other rules; the dispute tagging is not meant to recommend an outcome for this CVE Record.",
