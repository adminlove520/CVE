Prior to version 2.0.72, due to an error in command parsing, it was possible to bypass the Claude Code confirmation prompt to trigger execution of untrusted commands through the find command. Reliably exploiting this required the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.72.",

Prior to versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11, when the security mode is enabled, modifying the DATA Submessage within an \nSPDP packet sent by a publisher causes a heap buffer overflow, resulting in remote termination of Fast-DDS. If the fields \nof `PID_IDENTITY_TOKEN` or `PID_PERMISSIONS_TOKEN` in the DATA Submessage — specifically by tampering with the `str_size` \nvalue read by `readString` (called from `readBinaryProperty`) — are modified, a 32-bit integer overflow can occur, causing\n `std::vector::resize` to use an attacker-controlled size and quickly trigger heap buffer overflow and remote process term\nination. Versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11 patch the issue.",
