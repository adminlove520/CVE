      "description": "A vulnerability was found in Apereo CAS 5.2.6. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file cas-5.2.6\\core\\cas-server-core-configuration-metadata-repository\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apereo\\cas\\metadata\\rest\\CasConfigurationMetadataServerController.java. The manipulation of the argument Name leads to inefficient regular expression complexity. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
