      "description": "In Innoshop through 0.4.1, an authenticated attacker could exploit the File Manager functions in the admin panel to achieve code execution on the server, by uploading a crafted file and then renaming it to have a .php extension by using the Rename Function. This bypasses the initial check that uploaded files are image files. The application relies on frontend checks to restrict the administrator from changing the extension of uploaded files to .php. This restriction is easily bypassed with any proxy tool (e.g., BurpSuite). Once the attacker renames the file, and gives it the .php extension, a GET request can be used to trigger the execution of code on the server.",

      "description": "Innoshop through 0.4.1 allows directory traversal via FileManager API endpoints. An authenticated attacker with access to the admin panel could abuse this to: (1) fully map the filesystem structure via the /api/file_manager/files?base_folder= endpoint, (2) create arbitrary directories on the server via the /api/file_manager/directories endpoint, (3) read arbitrary files from the server by copying the file to a readable location within the application via the /api/file_manager/copy_files endpoint, {4) delete arbitrary files from the server via a DELETE request to /api/file_manager/files, or (5) create arbitrary files on the server by uploading them and then leveraging the /api/file_manager/move_files endpoint to move them anywhere in the filesystem.",
