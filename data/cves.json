      "description": "aiven-db-migrate is an Aiven database migration tool. Prior to 1.0.7, there is a privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a user to elevate to superuser inside PostgreSQL databases during a migration from an untrusted source server. By exploiting a lack of search_path restriction, an attacker can override pg_catalog and execute untrusted operators as a superuser. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.7.",

      "description": "Copier library and CLI app for rendering project templates. From 7.1.0 to before 9.9.1, Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one that doesn't use unsafe features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the --UNSAFE,--trust flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently write files outside the destination path where a project shall be generated or updated. This is possible when rendering a generated directory structure whose rendered path is either a relative parent path or an absolute path. Constructing such paths is possible using Copier's builtin pathjoin Jinja filter and its builtin _copier_conf.sep variable, which is the platform-native path separator. This way, a malicious template author can create a template that overwrites arbitrary files (according to the user's write permissions), e.g., to cause havoc. This vulnerability is fixed in 9.9.1.",
