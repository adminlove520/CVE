      "description": "A security vulnerability has been detected in tiny-rdm Tiny RDM up to 1.2.5. Affected by this vulnerability is the function pickle.loads of the file pickle_convert.go of the component Pickle Decoding. The manipulation leads to deserialization. The attack can be initiated remotely. A high degree of complexity is needed for the attack. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed publicly and may be used. The project was informed of the problem early through an issue report but has not responded yet.",
