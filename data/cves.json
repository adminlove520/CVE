      "description": "Vikunja is an open-source self-hosted task management platform. Versions prior to 2.1.0 have a business logic vulnerability exists in the password reset mechanism of vikunja/api that allows password reset tokens to be reused indefinitely. Due to a failure to invalidate tokens upon use and a critical logic bug in the token cleanup cron job, reset tokens remain valid forever. This allows an attacker who intercepts a single reset token (via logs, browser history, or phishing) to perform a complete, persistent account takeover at any point in the future, bypassing standard authentication controls. Version 2.1.0 contains a patch for the issue.",

Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 3.1.0, an authentication guard logic flaw in `POST /api/v1/auth/jellyfin` allows an unauthenticated attacker to register a new Seerr account on any Plex-configured instance by authenticating with an attacker-controlled Jellyfin server. The attacker receives an authenticated session and can immediately use the application with default permissions, including the ability to submit media requests to Radarr/Sonarr. Any Seerr deployment where all three of the following are true may be vulnerable: `settings.main.mediaServerType` is set to `PLEX` (the most common deployment).; `settings.jellyfin.ip` is set to `\"\"` (default, meaning Jellyfin was never configured); and `settings.main.newPlexLogin` is set to `true` (default). Jellyfin-configured and Emby-configured deployments are not affected. Version 3.1.0 of Seerr fixes this issue.",
