      "description": "A vulnerability was found in PyTorch 2.6.0+cu124. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function torch.ops.profiler._call_end_callbacks_on_jit_fut of the component Tuple Handler. The manipulation of the argument None leads to memory corruption. The attack can be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult.",

By flipping specific bits in the ZIP file headers, an attacker can embed malicious pickle files that remain undetected by PickleScan while still being successfully loaded by PyTorch's torch.load(). This can lead to arbitrary code execution when loading a compromised model.",

By modifying the filename in the ZIP header while keeping the original filename in the directory listing, an attacker can make PickleScan raise a BadZipFile error. However, PyTorch's more forgiving ZIP implementation still allows the model to be loaded, enabling malicious payloads to bypass detection.",
