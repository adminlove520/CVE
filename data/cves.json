An unauthenticated attacker could invoke the same URL used by the product's default-installation / first-admin creation page and create a new administrative account remotely. By gaining admin privileges, the attacker can change the ATM configuration resulting in redirected funds. Public vendor advisories and multiple independent writeups describe the vulnerability as a call to the page used for initial/default installation / first administration user creation; General Bytes has not publicly published the exact endpoint/parameter name. The issue was actively exploited in the wild against cloud-hosted and standalone CAS deployments (scanning exposed CAS instances on ports 7777/443), and publicly acknowledged by the General Bytes in September 2022.",

      "description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host and Application (macOS/Linux client deployments) are vulnerable to an authentication bypass in PrinterInstallerClientService. The service requires root privileges for certain administrative operations, but these checks rely on calls to geteuid(). By preloading a malicious shared object overriding geteuid(), a local attacker can trick the service into believing it is running with root privileges. This bypass enables execution of administrative commands (e.g., enabling debug mode, managing configurations, or invoking privileged features) without proper authorization. While some actions requiring write access to protected files may still fail, the flaw effectively breaks the intended security model of the inter-process communication (IPC) system, allowing local attackers to escalate privileges and compromise system integrity. NOTE: This vulnerability has been addressed, but an affected version range is not yet fully determined. We will update this record as soon as the vendor provides confirmed version information.",

A script named /var/www/app/resetroot.php (found in several containers) lacks authentication checks and, when executed, performs a SQL update that sets the database administrator username to 'root' and its password hash to the SHA-512 hash of the string 'password'. Separately, commented-out code in /var/www/app/lib/common/oses.php would unserialize session data (unserialize($_SESSION['osdata']))—a pattern that can enable remote code execution if re-enabled or reached with attacker-controlled serialized data.
