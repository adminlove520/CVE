      "description": "There is a relative path traversal vulnerability in the NI System Web Server that may result in information disclosure.  Successful exploitation requires an attacker to send a specially crafted request to the NI System Web Server, allowing the attacker to read arbitrary files.  This vulnerability existed in the NI System Web Server 2012 and prior versions.  It was fixed in 2013.",

      "description": "The E-POINT CMS eagle.gsam-1169.1 file upload feature improperly handles nested archive files. An attacker can upload a nested ZIP (a ZIP containing another ZIP) where the inner archive contains an executable file (e.g. webshell.php). When the application extracts the uploaded archives, the executable may be extracted into a web-accessible directory. This can lead to remote code execution (RCE), data disclosure, account compromise, or further system compromise depending on the web server/process privileges. The issue arises from insufficient validation of archive contents and inadequate restrictions on extraction targets.",
