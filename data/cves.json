      "description": "A vulnerability has been found in i-Drive i11 and i12 up to 20250227 and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component WiFi. The manipulation leads to use of default password. Access to the local network is required for this attack to succeed. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. It was not possible to identify the current maintainer of the product. It must be assumed that the product is end-of-life.",
