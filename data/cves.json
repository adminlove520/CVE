      "description": "The openml/openml.org web application version v2.0.20241110 uses incremental user IDs and insufficient email ownership verification during email update workflows. An authenticated attacker controlling a user account with a lower user ID can update their email address to that of another user with a higher user ID without proper verification. This results in the victim's email being reassigned to the attacker's account, causing the victim to be locked out immediately and unable to log in. The vulnerability leads to denial of service via account lockout but does not grant the attacker direct access to the victim's private data.",

      "description": "In Seagate Toolkit on Windows a vulnerability exists in the Toolkit Installer prior to versions 2.35.0.6 where it attempts to load DLLs from the current working directory without validating their origin or integrity. This behavior can be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer executable, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer. The issue stems from the use of insecure DLL loading practices, such as relying on relative paths or failing to specify fully qualified paths when invoking system libraries.",

Code injection may be possible in Gardener Extensions for AWS providers prior to version 1.64.0, Azure providers prior to version 1.55.0, OpenStack providers prior to version 1.49.0, and GCP providers prior to version 1.46.0. This vulnerability could allow a user with administrative privileges for a Gardener project to obtain control over the seed cluster where the shoot cluster is managed. This affects all Gardener installations where Terraformer is used/can be enabled for infrastructure provisioning with any of the affected components.
