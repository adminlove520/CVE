      "description": "Pyrofork is a modern, asynchronous MTProto API framework. Versions 2.3.68 and earlier do not properly sanitize filenames received from Telegram messages in the download_media method before using them in file path construction. When downloading media, if the user does not specify a custom filename (which is the common/default usage), the method falls back to using the file_name attribute from the media object. The attribute originates from Telegram's DocumentAttributeFilename and is controlled by the message sender. This issue is fixed in version 2.3.69.",

      "description": "Ibexa is a composable end-to-end DXP (Digital Experience Platform). Versions 5.0.0-beta1 through 5.0.3 do not have password validation. During the transition from v4 to v5 an error was introduced into validation code which causes the validation of the previous password not to run as expected. This makes it possible for a logged in user to change their password in the back office without knowing the previous password. For example, if a user logs into their account and walks away without locking their workstation, an attacker could access the unattended session and change the password, therefore locking the legitimate user out. This issue is fixed in version 5.0.4.",
