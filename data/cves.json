      "description": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the ping diagnostic feature of FiberHome FD602GW-DX-R410 router (firmware V2.2.14), allowing an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the router s web interface. The vulnerability is triggered via user-supplied input in the ping form field, which fails to sanitize special characters. This can be exploited to hijack sessions or escalate privileges through social engineering or browser-based attacks.",
