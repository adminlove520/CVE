      "description": "Ray is an AI compute engine. Prior to version 2.52.0, developers working with Ray as a development tool can be exploited via a critical RCE vulnerability exploitable via Firefox and Safari. This vulnerability is due to an insufficient guard against browser-based attacks, as the current defense uses the User-Agent header starting with the string \"Mozilla\" as a defense mechanism. This defense is insufficient as the fetch specification allows the User-Agent header to be modified. Combined with a DNS rebinding attack against the browser, and this vulnerability is exploitable against a developer running Ray who inadvertently visits a malicious website, or is served a malicious advertisement (malvertising). This issue has been patched in version 2.52.0.",
