      "description": "Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime. Versions 4.8.0 through 4.9.5 contain a flaw in the getPath utility function which could allow path confusion and potential bypass of proxy-level ACLs (e.g. Nginx location blocks). The original implementation relied on fixed character offsets when parsing request URLs. Under certain malformed absolute-form Request-URIs, this could lead to incorrect path extraction depending on the application and environment. If proxy ACLs are used to protect sensitive endpoints such as /admin, this flaw could have allowed unauthorized access. The confidentiality impact depends on what data is exposed: if sensitive administrative data is exposed, the impact may be high, otherwise it may be moderate. This issue is fixed in version 4.9.6.",
