      "description": "conda-forge-ci-setup is a package installed by conda-forge each time a build is run on CI. The conda-forge-ci-setup-feedstock setup script is vulnerable due to the unsafe use of the eval function when parsing version information from a custom-formatted meta.yaml file. An attacker controlling meta.yaml can inject malicious code into the version assignment, which is executed during file processing, leading to arbitrary code execution. Exploitation requires an attacker to modify the recipe file by manipulating the RECIPE_DIR variable and introducing a malicious meta.yaml file. While this is more feasible in CI/CD pipelines, it is uncommon in typical environments, reducing overall risk. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.15.0.",
