An attacker can craft a malicious webpage that submits a username-change request; when a victim visits the page while authenticated, the browser includes valid session cookies and the request succeeds. This allows an attacker to change the victim’s 1Panel username without consent. After the change, the victim is logged out and unable to log in with the previous username, resulting in account lockout and denial of service.",
