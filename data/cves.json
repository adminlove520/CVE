      "description": "The Custom Post Type UI plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.18.0. This is due to the plugin not verifying that a user has the required capability to perform actions in the \"cptui_process_post_type\" function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to add, edit, or delete custom post types in limited situations.",
