      "description": "Repostat is a React component to fetch and display GitHub repository info. Prior to version 1.0.1, the `RepoCard` component is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability occurs because the component uses React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render the repository name (`repo` prop) during the loading state without any sanitization. If a developer using this package passes unvalidated user input directly into the `repo` prop (for example, reading it from a URL query parameter), an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser. In version 1.0.1, the use of dangerouslySetInnerHTML has been removed, and the repo prop is now safely rendered using standard React JSX data binding, which automatically escapes HTML entities.",

The Android application stores programs in a local SQLite database (unitree_go2.db, table dog_programme) and transmits the programme_text content, including the pyCode field, to the robot. The robot's actuator_manager.py executes the supplied Python as root without integrity verification or content validation. An attacker with local access to the Android device can tamper with the stored programme record to inject arbitrary Python that executes when the user triggers the program via a controller keybinding, and the malicious binding persists across reboots. Additionally, a malicious program shared through the application's community marketplace can result in arbitrary code execution on any robot that imports and runs it.",
