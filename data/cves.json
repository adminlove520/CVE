      "description": "A vulnerability in an internal API of Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected device and then execute those files on the underlying operating system as root.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due a lack of file validation checks that would prevent uploaded files from being placed in privileged directories on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted file to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store malicious files on the affected system and then execute arbitrary code or obtain root privileges on the system.",

Versions 2.2.0 through 2.39.0 have no validation during the import process of a project or task backup to check that the filename specified in the query parameter refers to a TUS-uploaded file belonging to the same user. As a result, if an attacker with a CVAT account and a `user` role knows the filenames of other users' uploads, they could potentially access and steal data by creating projects or tasks using those files.  This issue does not affect annotation or dataset TUS uploads, since in this case object-specific temporary directories are used. Users should upgrade to CVAT 2.40.0 or a later version to receive a patch. No known workarounds are available.",
