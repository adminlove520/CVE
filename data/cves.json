      "description": "LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries stored in an LDAP directory. LAM before 9.3 allows stored cross-site scripting in the Profile section via the profile name field, which renders untrusted input as HTML and executes a supplied script (for example a script element). An authenticated user with permission to create or edit a profile can insert a script payload into the profile name and have it executed when the profile data is viewed in a browser. This issue is fixed in version 9.3. No known workarounds are mentioned.",

      "description": "Matrix JavaScript SDK is a Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. matrix-js-sdk before 38.2.0 has insufficient validation of room predecessor links in MatrixClient::getJoinedRooms, allowing a remote attacker to attempt to replace a tombstoned room with an unrelated attacker-supplied room. The issue has been patched and users should upgrade to 38.2.0. A workaround is to avoid using MatrixClient::getJoinedRooms in favor of getRooms() and filtering upgraded rooms separately.",
