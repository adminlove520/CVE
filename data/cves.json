      "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in IROAD Dash Cam X5 and Dash Cam X6 up to 20250308. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the component Device Pairing. The manipulation leads to hard-coded credentials. Access to the local network is required for this attack to succeed. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
