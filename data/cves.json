      "description": "A vulnerability was found in TRENDnet TEW-822DRE FW103B02. It has been classified as problematic. This affects an unknown part of the component vsftpd. The manipulation leads to least privilege violation. Attacking locally is a requirement. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
