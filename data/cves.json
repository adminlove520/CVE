      "description": "This vulnerability occurs when a WebSocket endpoint does not enforce \nproper authentication mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to \nestablish connections. As a result, attackers can exploit this weakness \nto gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform unauthorized \nactions. Given that no authentication is required, this can lead to \nprivilege escalation and potentially compromise the security of the \nentire system.",

      "description": "Runtipi is a Docker-based, personal homeserver orchestrator that facilitates multiple services on a single server. Versions 3.7.0 and above allow an authenticated user to execute arbitrary system commands on the host server by injecting shell metacharacters into backup filenames. The BackupManager fails to sanitize the filenames of uploaded backups. The system persists user-uploaded files directly to the host filesystem using the raw originalname provided in the request. This allows an attacker to stage a file containing shell metacharacters (e.g., $(id).tar.gz) at a predictable path, which is later referenced during the restore process. The successful storage of the file is what allows the subsequent restore command to reference and execute it. This issue has been fixed in version 4.7.0.",

      "description": "This vulnerability arises because there are no limitations on the number\n of authentication attempts a user can make. An attacker can exploit \nthis weakness by continuously sending authentication requests, leading \nto a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This can overwhelm the \nauthentication system, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users and \npotentially causing service disruption. This can also allow attackers to\n conduct brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access.",
