      "description": "OneUptime is a solution for monitoring and managing online services. In versions 9.5.13 and below, custom JavaScript monitor feature uses Node.js's node:vm module (explicitly documented as not a security mechanism) to execute user-supplied code, allowing trivial sandbox escape via a well-known one-liner that grants full access to the underlying process. Because the probe runs with host networking and holds all cluster credentials (ONEUPTIME_SECRET, DATABASE_PASSWORD, REDIS_PASSWORD, CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD) in its environment variables, and monitor creation is available to the lowest role (ProjectMember) with open registration enabled by default, any anonymous user can achieve full cluster compromise in about 30 seconds.

      "description": "Static Web Server (SWS) is a production-ready web server suitable for static web files or assets. In versions 2.1.0 through 2.40.1, a timing-based username enumeration vulnerability in Basic Authentication allows attackers to identify valid users by exploiting early responses for invalid usernames, enabling targeted brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks. SWS checks whether a username exists before verifying the password, causing valid usernames to follow a slower code path (e.g., bcrypt hashing) while invalid usernames receive an immediate 401 response. This timing discrepancy allows attackers to enumerate valid accounts by measuring response-time differences. This issue has been fixed in version 2.41.0.",
