      "description": "vantage6 is an open source framework built to enable, manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning and Multi-Party Computation. If attacker gets access to an authenticated session, they can try to brute-force the user password by using the change password functionality: they can call that route infinitely which will return the message that password is wrong until it is correct. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.11.",
