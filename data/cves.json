      "description": "1Panel is a web interface and MCP Server that manages websites, files, containers, databases, and LLMs on a Linux server. In versions 2.0.5 and below, the HTTPS protocol used for communication between the Core and Agent endpoints has incomplete certificate verification during certificate validation, leading to unauthorized interface access. Due to the presence of numerous command execution or high-privilege interfaces in 1Panel, this results in Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is fixed in version 2.0.6. The CVE has been translated from Simplified Chinese using GitHub Copilot.",

Affected by this vulnerability is the function t2p_read_tiff_init of the file tools/tiff2pdf.c of the component fax2ps. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. The attack needs to be approached locally. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The patch is named 2ebfffb0e8836bfb1cd7d85c059cd285c59761a4. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",

      "description": "An authenticated OS command injection vulnerability exists in various D-Link routers (tested on DIR-615H1 running firmware version 8.04) via the tools_vct.htm endpoint. The web interface fails to sanitize input passed from the ping_ipaddr parameter to the tools_vct.htm diagnostic interface, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands using backtick encapsulation. With default credentials, an attacker can exploit this blind injection vector to execute arbitrary commands.",
