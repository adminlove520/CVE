      "description": "A vulnerability was found in JeecgBoot up to 3.9.0. The impacted element is the function loadDatarule of the file /sys/sysDepartRole/datarule/. Performing manipulation of the argument departId/roleId results in improper authorization. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The attack is considered to have high complexity. The exploitability is regarded as difficult. The exploit has been made public and could be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
