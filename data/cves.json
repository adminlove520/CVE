      "description": "Saurus CMS Community Edition since commit d886e5b0 (2010-04-23) is vulnerable to a SQL Injection vulnerability in the `prepareSearchQuery()` method in `FulltextSearch.class.php`. The application directly concatenates user-supplied input (`$search_word`) into SQL queries without sanitization, allowing attackers to manipulate the SQL logic and potentially extract sensitive information or escalate their privileges.",

      "description": "The modelscope/ms-swift library thru 2.6.1 is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution through deserialization of untrusted data within the `load_model_meta()` function of the `ModelFileSystemCache()` class. Attackers can execute arbitrary code and commands by crafting a malicious serialized `.mdl` payload, exploiting the use of `pickle.load()` on data from potentially untrusted sources. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading a seemingly harmless checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine. Note that the payload file is a hidden file, making it difficult for the victim to detect tampering. More importantly, during the model training process, after the `.mdl` file is loaded and executes arbitrary code, the normal training process remains unaffected'meaning the user remains unaware of the arbitrary code execution.",
