      "description": "vscode-spell-checker is a basic spell checker that works well with code and documents. Prior to v4.5.4, DocumentSettings._determineIsTrusted treats the configuration value cSpell.trustedWorkspace as the authoritative trust flag. The value defaults to true (package.json) and is read from workspace configuration each time settings are fetched. The code coerces any truthy value to true and forwards it to ConfigLoader.setIsTrusted , which in turn allows JavaScript/TypeScript configuration files ( .cspell.config.js/.mjs/.ts , etc.) to be located and executed. Because no VS Code workspace-trust state is consulted, an untrusted workspace can keep the flag true and place a malicious .cspell.config.js ; opening the workspace causes the extension host to execute attacker-controlled Node.js code with the user’s privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in v4.5.4.",

      "description": "go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure Go. Prior to 5.16.5, a vulnerability was discovered in go-git whereby data integrity values for .pack and .idx files were not properly verified. This resulted in go-git potentially consuming corrupted files, which would likely result in unexpected errors such as object not found. For context, clients fetch packfiles from upstream Git servers. Those files contain a checksum of their contents, so that clients can perform integrity checks before consuming it. The pack indexes (.idx) are generated locally by go-git, or the git cli, when new .pack files are received and processed. The integrity checks for both files were not being verified correctly. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.16.5.",
