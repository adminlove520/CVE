      "description": "A vulnerability was found in i-Drive i11 and i12 up to 20250227. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the component Device Setting Handler. The manipulation leads to improper access control for register interface. The attack needs to be done within the local network. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. It was not possible to identify the current maintainer of the product. It must be assumed that the product is end-of-life.",
