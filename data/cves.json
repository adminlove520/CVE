      "description": "LF Edge eKuiper is a lightweight internet of things (IoT) data analytics and stream processing engine. Prior to version 2.1.0 user with rights to modificate the service (e.g. kuiperUser role) can inject a cross-site scripting payload into Connection Configuration key `Name` (`confKey`) parameter. After this setup, when any user with access to this service (e.g. admin) tries to delete this key, a payload acts in the victim's browser. Version 2.1.0 fixes the issue.",
