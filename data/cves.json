      "description": "A weakness has been identified in CRMEB up to 5.6.3. The impacted element is the function remoteRegister of the file crmeb/app/services/user/LoginServices.php of the component JSON Token Handler. Executing a manipulation of the argument uid can lead to improper authentication. The attack may be performed from remote. The attack requires a high level of complexity. The exploitability is regarded as difficult. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be used for attacks. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
