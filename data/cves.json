Some of these files contain hard-coded credentials. The vulnerability allows an attacker to read configuration files containing hard-coded credentials. The attacker could then authenticate to the database or other services if those credentials are reused. The attacker must be authenticated and have the required permissions. However, the vulnerability is easy to exploit and the application source code is public. This problem is fixed in LORIS v26.0.5 and v27.0.2 and above, and v28.0.0 and above. As a workaround, the electrophysiogy_browser in LORIS can be disabled by an administrator using the module manager.",

      "description": "GetSimple CMS is a content management system. All versions of GetSimple CMS do not implement CSRF protection on the administrative file upload endpoint. As a result, an attacker can craft a malicious web page that silently triggers a file upload request from an authenticated victim’s browser. The request is accepted without requiring a CSRF token or origin validation. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the application without the victim’s knowledge or consent. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the victim must be authenticated to GetSimple CMS (e.g., admin user), and visit an attacker-controlled webpage.

      "description": "svelte performance oriented web framework. Prior to 5.51.5, in server-side rendering, attribute spreading on elements (e.g. <div {...attrs}>) enumerates inherited properties from the object's prototype chain rather than only own properties. In environments where Object.prototype has already been polluted — a precondition outside of Svelte's control — this can cause unexpected attributes to appear in SSR output or cause SSR to throw errors. Client-side rendering is not affected. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.51.5.",
