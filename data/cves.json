      "description": "EDB Hybrid Manager contains a flaw that allows an unauthenticated attacker to directly access certain gRPC endpoints. This could allow an attacker to read potentially sensitive data or possibly cause a denial-of-service by writing malformed data to certain gRPC endpoints. This flaw has been remediated in EDB Hybrid Manager 1.3.3, and customers should consider upgrading to 1.3.3 as soon as possible.\nThe flaw is due to a misconfiguration in the Istio Gateway, which manages authentication and authorization for the affected endpoints. The security policy relies on an explicit definition of required permissions in the Istio Gateway configuration, and the affected endpoints were not defined in the configuration. This allowed requests to bypass both authentication and authorization within a Hybrid Manager service.\nAll versions of Hybrid Manager - LTS should be upgraded to 1.3.3, and all versions of Hybrid Manager - Innovation should be upgraded to 2025.12.",
