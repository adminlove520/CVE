      "description": "A vulnerability has been found in Tenda O3V2 1.0.0.12(3880) and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function fromNetToolGet of the file /goform/setPingInfo of the component httpd. The manipulation of the argument ip leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

      "description": "GNU Tar through 1.35 allows file overwrite via directory traversal in crafted TAR archives, with a certain two-step process. First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal.",
