This affects the function getUserLanguage of the file classes/class.database.php. The manipulation of the argument user_id leads to sql injection. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
