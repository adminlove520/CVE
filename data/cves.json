During the EAP-Response/Identity exchange, the subscriber's full Network Access Identifier (NAI), which embeds the raw IMSI, is transmitted without encryption, tunneling, or pseudonymization. An attacker located within Wi-Fi range (~100 meters) can passively capture these frames without requiring user interaction or elevated privileges. The disclosed IMSI enables device tracking, subscriber correlation, and long-term monitoring of user presence near any broadcasting Freebox device. The vendor acknowledged the vulnerability, and the `FreeWifi_secure` service is planned for full deactivation by 1 October 2025.",
