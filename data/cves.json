      "description": "dedupe is a python library that uses machine learning to perform fuzzy matching, deduplication and entity resolution quickly on structured data. Before commit 3f61e79, a critical severity vulnerability has been identified within the .github/workflows/benchmark-bot.yml workflow, where a issue_comment can be triggered using the @benchmark body. This workflow is susceptible to exploitation as it checkout the ${{ github.event.issue.number }}, which correspond to the branch of the PR manipulated by potentially malicious actors, and where untrusted code may be executed. Running untrusted code may lead to the exfiltration of GITHUB_TOKEN, which in this workflow has write permissions on most of the scopes - in particular the contents one - and could lead to potential repository takeover. This is fixed by commit 3f61e79.",

This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Tesla Wall Connector devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the firmware upgrade feature. The issue results from the lack of an anti-downgrade mechanism. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-26299.",
