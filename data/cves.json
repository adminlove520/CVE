      "description": "XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions before 15.10.16, 16.0.0-rc-1 through 16.4.6, and 16.5.0-rc-1 through 16.10.1, when an attacker without script or programming right creates an XClass definition in XWiki (requires edit right), and that same document is later edited by a user with script, admin, or programming right, malicious code could be executed with the rights of the editing user without prior warning. In particular, this concerns custom display code, the script of computed properties and queries in database list properties. Note that warnings before editing documents with dangerous properties have only been introduced in XWiki 15.9, before that version, this was a known issue and the advice was simply to be careful. This has been patched in XWiki 16.10.2, 16.4.7 and 15.10.16 by adding an analysis for the respective XClass properties.",

      "description": "XWiki is a generic wiki platform. When a user without script right creates a document with an `XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationEmailRendererClass` object, and later an admin edits and saves that document, the email templates in this object will be used for notifications. No malicious code can be executed, though, as while these templates allow Velocity code, the existing generic analyzer already warns admins before editing Velocity code. The main impact would thus be to send spam, e.g., with phishing links to other users or to hide notifications about other attacks. Note that warnings before editing documents with dangerous properties have only been introduced in XWiki 15.9, before that version, this was a known issue and the advice was simply to be careful.

      "description": "XWiki is a generic wiki platform. When editing content that contains \"dangerous\" macros like malicious script macros that were authored by a user with fewer rights, XWiki warns about the execution of these macros since XWiki 15.9RC1. These required rights analyzers that trigger these warnings are incomplete, allowing an attacker to hide malicious content. For most macros, the existing analyzers don't consider non-lowercase parameters. Further, most macro parameters that can contain XWiki syntax like titles of information boxes weren't analyzed at all. Similarly, the \"source\" parameters of the content and context macro weren't anylzed even though they could contain arbitrary XWiki syntax. In the worst case, this could allow a malicious to add malicious script macros including Groovy or Python macros to a page that are then executed after another user with programming righs edits the page, thus allowing remote code execution. The required rights analyzers have been made more robust and extended to cover those cases in XWiki 16.4.7, 16.10.3 and 17.0.0.",
