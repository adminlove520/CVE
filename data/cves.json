      "description": "A weakness has been identified in Beetel 777VR1 up to 01.00.09/01.00.09_55. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component UART Interface. Executing a manipulation can lead to weak password requirements. The physical device can be targeted for the attack. The attack requires a high level of complexity. It is stated that the exploitability is difficult. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be used for attacks. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
