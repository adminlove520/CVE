      "description": "Strapi is an open source headless CMS. The @strapi/core package before version 5.10.3 does not enforce a maximum password length when using bcryptjs for password hashing. Bcryptjs ignores any bytes beyond 72, so passwords longer than 72 bytes are silently truncated. A user can create an account with a password exceeding 72 bytes and later authenticate with only the first 72 bytes. This reduces the effective entropy of overlong passwords and may mislead users who believe characters beyond 72 bytes are required, creating a low likelihood of unintended authentication if an attacker can obtain or guess the truncated portion. Long over‑length inputs can also impose unnecessary processing overhead. The issue is fixed in version 5.10.3. No known workarounds exist.",

      "description": "Allstar is a GitHub App to set and enforce security policies. In versions prior to 4.5, a vulnerability in Allstar’s Reviewbot component caused inbound webhook requests to be validated against a hard-coded, shared secret. The value used for the secret token was compiled into the Allstar binary and could not be configured at runtime. In practice, this meant that every deployment using Reviewbot would validate requests with the same secret unless the operator modified source code and rebuilt the component - an expectation that is not documented and is easy to miss. All Allstar releases prior to v4.5 that include the Reviewbot code path are affected. Deployments on v4.5 and later are not affected. Those who have not enabled or exposed the Reviewbot endpoint are not exposed to this issue.",
