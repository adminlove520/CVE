      "description": "The CS Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the cs_widget_file_delete() function in all versions up to, and including, 6.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).",
