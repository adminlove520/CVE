      "description": "PocketMine-MP versions prior to 4.18.1 contain an improper input validation vulnerability in inventory transaction handling. A remote attacker with a valid player session can request that the server drop more items than are available in the player's hotbar, triggering a server crash and resulting in denial of service.",

      "description": "Cowrie versions prior to 2.9.0 contain a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the emulated shell implementation of wget and curl. In the default emulated shell configuration, these command emulations perform real outbound HTTP requests to attacker-supplied destinations. Because no outbound request rate limiting was enforced, unauthenticated remote attackers could repeatedly invoke these commands to generate unbounded HTTP traffic toward arbitrary third-party targets, allowing the Cowrie honeypot to be abused as a denial-of-service amplification node and masking the attacker’s true source address behind the honeypot’s IP.",
