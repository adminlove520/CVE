      "description": "mailgen is a Node.js package that generates responsive HTML e-mails for sending transactional mail. Prior to version 2.0.30, there is an HTML injection vulnerability in plaintext e-mails generated by Mailgen. Projects are affected if the Mailgen.generatePlaintext(email) method is used and given user-generated content. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.0.30. A workaround involves stripping all HTML tags before passing any content into Mailgen.generatePlaintext(email).",
