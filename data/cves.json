      "description": "n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Versions 0.123.1 through 1.119.1 do not have adequate protections to prevent RCE through the project's pre-commit hooks. The Add Config operation allows workflows to set arbitrary Git configuration values, including core.hooksPath, which can point to a malicious Git hook that executes arbitrary commands on the n8n host during subsequent Git operations. Exploitation requires the ability to create or modify an n8n workflow using the Git node. This issue is fixed in version 1.119.2. Workarounds include excluding the Git Node (Docs) and avoiding cloning or interacting with untrusted repositories using the Git Node.",
