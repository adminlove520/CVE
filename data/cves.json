      "description": "This admin plugin for Grav is an HTML user interface that provides a convenient way to configure Grav and easily create and modify pages. Prior to 1.11.0-beta.1, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the /admin/accounts/groups/Grupo endpoint of the Grav application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the data[readableName] parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.11.0-beta.1.",
