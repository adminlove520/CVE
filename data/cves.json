      "description": "A security vulnerability has been detected in FNKvision Y215 CCTV Camera 10.194.120.40. This issue affects the function crypt of the file /etc/passwd. The manipulation leads to use of weak hash. The attack can only be performed from a local environment. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is assessed as difficult. The exploit has been disclosed publicly and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
