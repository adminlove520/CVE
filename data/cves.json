In versions prior to 16.0.92 for FreePBX 16 and versions prior to 17.0.6 for FreePBX 17, the Endpoint Manager module contains an authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability affecting the fwbrand parameter. The fwbrand parameter allows an attacker to change the file path. Combined, these issues can result in a webshell being uploaded. Authentication with a known username is required to exploit this vulnerability. Successful exploitation allows authenticated users to upload arbitrary files to attacker-controlled paths on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.

      "description": "Flowise v3.0.1 < 3.0.8 and all versions after with 'ALLOW_BUILTIN_DEP' enabled contain an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability and node VM sandbox escape due to insecure use of integrated modules (Puppeteer and Playwright) within the nodevm execution environment. An authenticated attacker able to create or run a tool that leverages Puppeteer/Playwright can specify attacker-controlled browser binary paths and parameters. When the tool executes, the attacker-controlled executable/parameters are run on the host and circumvent the intended nodevm sandbox restrictions, resulting in execution of arbitrary code in the context of the host. This vulnerability was incorrectly assigned as a duplicate CVE-2025-26319 by the developers and should be considered distinct from that identifier.",

      "description": "FreePBX Endpoint Manager is a module for managing telephony endpoints in FreePBX systems. In versions prior to 16.0.92 for FreePBX 16 and versions prior to 17.0.6 for FreePBX 17, the Endpoint Manager module contains authenticated SQL injection vulnerabilities affecting multiple parameters in the basestation, model, firmware, and custom extension configuration functionality areas. Authentication with a known username is required to exploit these vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially enabling access to sensitive data or modification of database contents. This issue has been patched in version 16.0.92 for FreePBX 16 and version 17.0.6 for FreePBX 17.",
