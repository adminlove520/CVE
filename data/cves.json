      "description": "The StreamTube Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User Password Change in versions up to, and including, 4.78. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts. Note: This can only be exploited if the 'registration password fields' enabled in theme options.",
