      "description": "Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.451, an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the Database Import functionality allows users with application/service management permissions to execute arbitrary commands as root on managed servers. Database names used in import operations are passed directly to shell commands without sanitization, enabling full remote code execution. Version 4.0.0-beta.451 fixes the issue.",
