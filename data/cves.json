      "description": "drawnix is an all in one open-source whiteboard tool. In drawnix versions through 0.2.1, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the debug logging functionality. User controlled content is inserted directly into the DOM via innerHTML without sanitization when the global function __drawnix__web__console is invoked, as shown in apps/web/src/app/app.tsx where div.innerHTML = value is executed. This can allow arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the application if an attacker can cause untrusted data to be passed to the debug logger (for example via a malicious extension or other injection vector), potentially exposing user data or enabling unauthorized actions. The issue is fixed in version 0.3.0. Updating to 0.3.0 or later is recommended. No known workarounds exist.",

      "description": "A vulnerability in Apache Fory allows a remote attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). The issue stems from the insecure deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can supply a large, specially crafted data payload that, when processed, consumes an excessive amount of CPU resources during the deserialization process. This leads to CPU exhaustion, rendering the application or system using the Apache Fory library unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.\n\nUsers of Apache Fory are strongly advised to upgrade to version 0.12.2 or later to mitigate this vulnerability. Developers of libraries and applications that depend on Apache Fory should update their dependency requirements to Apache Fory 0.12.2 or later and release new versions of their software.",
