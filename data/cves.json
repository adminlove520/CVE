      "description": "QiAnXin TianQing Management Center versions up to and including 6.7.0.4130 contain a path traversal vulnerability in the rptsvr component that allows unauthenticated attackers to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server. The /rptsvr/upload endpoint fails to sanitize the filename parameter in multipart form-data requests, enabling path traversal. This allows attackers to place executable files in web-accessible directories, potentially leading to remote code execution. Exploitation evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2024-08-23 UTC.",
