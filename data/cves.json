      "description": "OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. Versions 16.3.0 through 16.6.4 are affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Roadmap view. OpenProject’s roadmap view renders the “Related work packages” list for each version. When a version contains work packages from a different project (e.g., a subproject), the helper link_to_work_package prepends package.project.to_s to the link and returns the entire string with .html_safe. Because project names are user-controlled and no escaping happens before calling html_safe, any HTML placed in a subproject name is injected verbatim into the page. The underlying issue is mitigated in versions 16.6.5 and 17.0.0 by setting a `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header, which was in place until a refactoring move to Rails standard content-security policy, which did not properly apply this header in the new configuration since OpenProject 16.3.0. Those who cannot upgrade their installations should ensure that they add a X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header in their proxying web application server.",

      "description": "OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. Users of OpenProject versions prior to 16.6.5 and 17.0.1 have the ability to view and end their active sessions via Account Settings → Sessions. When deleting a session, it was not properly checked if the session belongs to the user. As the ID that is used to identify these session objects use incremental integers, users could iterate requests using `DELETE /my/sessions/:id` and thus unauthenticate other users. Users did not have access to any sensitive information (like browser identifier, IP addresses, etc) of other users that are stored in the session. The problem was patched in OpenProject versions 16.6.5 and 17.0.1. No known workarounds are available as this does not require any permissions or other that can temporarily be disabled.",
