By supplying path traversal sequences, an authenticated attacker can cause the server to create upload-related artifacts outside the intended storage location. In certain configurations this enables arbitrary file write and may be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.",

An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this issue via blind SQL injection, allowing for the extraction of arbitrary data from the database, if the database connection is configured to use the ODBC plugin. The vulnerability arises from insufficient escaping of single quotes in the class SQLString (file odbc-store.cpp, lines 253-271).\n\nThis issue affects Shibboleth Service Provider through 3.5.0.",

      "description": "A SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in the SMPP server component of the SMSEagle firmware, specifically affecting the handling of certain parameters within the server's database interactions. The vulnerability is isolated to the SMPP server, which operates with its own dedicated database, separate from the main software's database. This isolation limits the scope of the vulnerability to the SMPP server's operations. The vulnerability arises from improper sanitization of user input in the SMPP server's scripts.\n\nThis issue has been fixed in version 6.11.",
