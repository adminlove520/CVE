      "description": "A flaw has been found in Tomofun Furbo 360 and Furbo Mini. This issue affects some unknown processing of the component GATT Service. This manipulation of the argument DeviceToken causes information disclosure. The attack is only possible within the local network. A high degree of complexity is needed for the attack. The exploitability is assessed as difficult. The exploit has been published and may be used. The firmware versions determined to be affected are Furbo 360 up to FB0035_FW_036 and Furbo Mini up to MC0020_FW_074. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
