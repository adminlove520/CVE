      "description": "Beszel is a server monitoring platform. Prior to version 0.18.2, the hub's authenticated API endpoints GET /api/beszel/containers/logs and GET /api/beszel/containers/info pass the user-supplied \"container\" query parameter to the agent without validation. The agent constructs Docker Engine API URLs using fmt.Sprintf with the raw value instead of url.PathEscape(). Since Go's http.Client does not sanitize `../` sequences from URL paths sent over unix sockets, an authenticated user (including readonly role) can traverse to arbitrary Docker API endpoints on agent hosts, exposing sensitive infrastructure details. Version 0.18.4 fixes the issue.",

Prior to version 9.4.0, the calibre Content Server's brute-force protection mechanism uses a ban key derived from both `remote_addr` and the `X-Forwarded-For` header. Since the `X-Forwarded-For` header is read directly from the HTTP request without any validation or trusted-proxy configuration, an attacker can bypass IP-based bans by simply changing or adding this header, rendering the brute-force protection completely ineffective. This is particularly dangerous for calibre servers exposed to the internet, where brute-force protection is the primary defense against credential stuffing and password guessing attacks.
