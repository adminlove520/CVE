      "description": "GPT-SoVITS-WebUI is a voice conversion and text-to-speech webUI. In versions 20250228v3 and prior, there is an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in vr.py AudioPreDeEcho. The model_choose variable takes user input (e.g. a path to a model) and passes it to the uvr function. In uvr, a new instance of AudioPreDeEcho class is created with the model_path attribute containing the aforementioned user input (here called locally model_name). Note that in this step the .pth extension is added to the path. In the AudioPreDeEcho class, the user input, here called model_path, is used to load the model on that path with torch.load, which can lead to unsafe deserialization. At time of publication, no known patched versions are available.",

      "description": "The attack vector is a potential Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient check on the length of a decompressed domain name within a DNS packet.\r\n\r\nAn attacker can craft a malicious DNS packet containing a highly compressed domain name. When the resolv library parses such a packet, the name decompression process consumes a large amount of CPU resources, as the library does not limit the resulting length of the name.\r\n\r\nThis resource consumption can cause the application thread to become unresponsive, resulting in a Denial of Service condition.",
