      "description": "vCluster Platform provides a Kubernetes platform for managing virtual clusters, multi-tenancy, and cluster sharing. Prior to versions 4.6.0, 4.5.4, 4.4.2, and 4.3.10, when an access key is created with a limited scope, the scope can be bypassed to access resources outside of it. However, the user still cannot access resources beyond what is accessible to the owner of the access key. Versions 4.6.0, 4.5.4, 4.4.2, and 4.3.10 fix the vulnerability. Some other mitigations are available. Users can limit exposure by reviewing access keys which are scoped and ensuring any users with access to them have appropriate permissions set. Creating automation users with very limited permissions and using access keys for these automation users can be used as a temporary workaround where upgrading is not immediately possible but scoped access keys are needed.",

It's possible for an authenticated backoffice-user to enumerate and traverse paths/files on the systems filesystem and read their contents, on Mac/Linux Umbraco installations using Forms. As Umbraco Cloud runs in a Windows environment, Cloud users aren't affected. This issue affects versions 16 and 17 of Umbraco Forms and is patched in 16.4.1 and 17.1.1. If upgrading is not immediately possible, users can mitigate this vulnerability by configuring a WAF or reverse proxy to block requests containing path traversal sequences (`../`, `..\\`) in the `fileName` parameter of the export endpoint, restricting network access to the Umbraco backoffice to trusted IP ranges, and/or blocking the `/umbraco/forms/api/v1/export` endpoint entirely if the export feature is not required. However, upgrading to the patched version is strongly recommended.",
