      "description": "onion-site-template is a complete, scalable tor hidden service self-hosting sample. Versions which include commit 3196bd89 contain a baked-in tor image if the secrets were copied from an existing onion domain. A website could be compromised if a user shared the baked-in image, or if someone were able to acquire access to the user's device outside of a containerized environment. This is fixed by commit bc9ba0fd.",
