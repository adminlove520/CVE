      "description": "The LazyTasks – Project & Task Management with Collaboration, Kanban and Gantt Chart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.29. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity via the 'wp-json/lazytasks/api/v1/user/role/edit/' REST API endpoint prior to updating their details like email address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account. It is also possible for attackers to abuse this endpoint to grant users with access to additional roles within the plugin",

      "description": "The vulnerability affects Ignition SCADA applications where Python \nscripting is utilized for automation purposes. The vulnerability arises \nfrom the absence of proper security controls that restrict which Python \nlibraries can be imported and executed within the scripting environment.\n The core issue lies in the Ignition service account having system \npermissions beyond what an Ignition privileged user requires. When an \nauthenticated administrator uploads a malicious project file containing \nPython scripts with bind shell capabilities, the application executes \nthese scripts with the same privileges as the Ignition Gateway process, \nwhich typically runs with SYSTEM-level permissions on Windows. \nAlternative code execution patterns could lead to similar results.",
