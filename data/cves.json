      "description": "A vulnerability was found in IROAD Dash Cam X5 up to 20250203. It has been rated as problematic. This issue affects some unknown processing of the component SSID. The manipulation leads to use of default credentials. The attack needs to be initiated within the local network. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
