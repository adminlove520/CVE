      "description": "Value provided in one of POST parameters sent during the process of logging in to Times Software E-Payroll is not sanitized properly, which allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform DoS attacks. SQL injection attacks might also be feasible, although so far creating a working exploit has been prevented probably by backend filtering mechanisms.\nAdditionally, command injection attempts cause the application to return extensive error messages disclosing some information about the internal infrastructure. \nPatching status is unknown because the vendor has not replied to messages sent by the CNA.",

      "description": "A code injection vulnerability exists in baryhuang/mcp-server-aws-resources-python 0.1.0 that allows remote code execution through insufficient input validation in the execute_query method. The vulnerability stems from the exposure of dangerous Python built-in functions (__import__, getattr, hasattr) in the execution namespace and the direct use of exec() to execute user-supplied code. An attacker can craft malicious queries to execute arbitrary Python code, leading to AWS credential theft (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY), file system access, environment variable disclosure, and potential system compromise. The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass intended security controls and gain unauthorized access to sensitive AWS resources and credentials stored in the server's environment.",

      "description": "A command injection vulnerability exists in the MCP Data Science Server's (reading-plus-ai/mcp-server-data-exploration) 0.1.6 in the safe_eval() function (src/mcp_server_ds/server.py:108). The function uses Python's exec() to execute user-supplied scripts but fails to restrict the __builtins__ dictionary in the globals parameter. When __builtins__ is not explicitly defined, Python automatically provides access to all built-in functions including __import__, exec, eval, and open. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code with full system privileges, leading to complete system compromise. The vulnerability can be exploited by submitting a malicious script to the run_script tool, requiring no authentication or special privileges.",
