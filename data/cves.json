      "description": "During the AWS Client VPN client installation on Windows devices, the install process references the C:\\usr\\local\\windows-x86_64-openssl-localbuild\\ssl directory location to fetch the OpenSSL configuration file. As a result, a non-admin user could place arbitrary code in the configuration file. If an admin user starts the AWS Client VPN client installation process, that code could be executed with root-level privileges. This issue does not affect Linux or Mac devices. \n\nWe recommend users discontinue any new installations of AWS Client VPN on Windows prior to version 5.2.2.",
