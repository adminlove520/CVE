      "description": "A vulnerability was found in Meteor up to 3.2.1 and classified as problematic. This issue affects the function Object.assign of the file packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js. The manipulation of the argument forwardedFor leads to inefficient regular expression complexity. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 3.2.2 is able to address this issue. The identifier of the patch is f7ea6817b90952baaea9baace2a3b4366fee6a63. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",

      "description": "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') vulnerability in QFileSystemEngine in the Qt corelib module on Windows which potentially allows Symlink Attacks and the use of Malicious Files. Issue originates from CVE-2024-38081. The vulnerability arises from the use of the GetTempPath API, which can be exploited by attackers to manipulate temporary file paths, potentially leading to unauthorized access and privilege escalation. The affected public API in the Qt Framework is QDir::tempPath() and anything that uses it, such as QStandardPaths with TempLocation, QTemporaryDir, and QTemporaryFile.This issue affects all version of Qt up to and including 5.15.18, from 6.0.0 through 6.5.8, from 6.6.0 through 6.8.1. It is fixed in Qt 5.15.19, Qt 6.5.9, Qt 6.8.2, 6.9.0",
