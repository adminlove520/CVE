      "description": "The Angular SSR is a server-rise rendering tool for Angular applications. An Open Redirect vulnerability exists in the internal URL processing logic in versions on the 19.x branch prior to 19.2.21, the 20.x branch prior to 20.3.17, and the 21.x branch prior to 21.1.5 and 21.2.0-rc.1. The logic normalizes URL segments by stripping leading slashes; however, it only removes a single leading slash. When an Angular SSR application is deployed behind a proxy that passes the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header, an attacker can provide a value starting with three slashes. This vulnerability allows attackers to conduct large-scale phishing and SEO hijacking. In order to be vulnerable, the application must use Angular SSR, the application must have routes that perform internal redirects, the infrastructure (Reverse Proxy/CDN) must pass the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header to the SSR process without sanitization, and the cache must not vary on the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header. Versions 21.2.0-rc.1, 21.1.5, 20.3.17, and 19.2.21 contain a patch. Until the patch is applied, developers should sanitize the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header in their`server.ts` before the Angular engine processes the request.",

These versions do not prevent this issue in their default configuration to avoid breaking preexisting behaviors. All versions of Wasmtime have appropriate knobs to prevent this behavior, and Wasmtime 42.0.0-and-later will have these knobs tuned by default to prevent this issue from happening. There are no known workarounds for this issue without upgrading. Embedders are recommended to upgrade and configure their embeddings as necessary to prevent possibly-malicious guests from triggering this issue.",

In versions 4.4.0 through 4.4.13 and 4.5.0 through 4.5.6, actions performed by a FASP to subscribe to account/content lifecycle events or to backfill content did not check properly whether the FASP was actually approved. This only affects Mastodon servers that have opted in to testing the experimental FASP feature by setting the environment variable `EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES` to a value including `fasp`. An attacker can make subscriptions and request content backfill without approval by an administrator. Done once, this leads to minor information leak of URIs that are publicly available anyway. But done several times this is a serious vector for DOS, putting pressure on the sidekiq worker responsible for the `fasp` queue. The fix is included in the 4.4.14 and 4.5.7 releases.

The CSRF token is constructed partially from the secret key, and this can be used to check if the brute force succeeded. Trying all possible values takes approximately one hour. The impact of this is limited. The auto login key uses the user's password on top of the secret key. The pwg token uses the user's session identifier on top of the secret key.

      "description": "Caddy is an extensible server platform that uses TLS by default. Prior to version 2.11.1, Caddy's FastCGI path splitting logic computes the split index on a lowercased copy of the request path and then uses that byte index to slice the original path. This is unsafe for Unicode because `strings.ToLower()` can change UTF-8 byte length for some characters. As a result, Caddy can derive an incorrect `SCRIPT_NAME`/`SCRIPT_FILENAME` and `PATH_INFO`, potentially causing a request that contains `.php` to execute a different on-disk file than intended (path confusion). In setups where an attacker can control file contents (e.g., upload features), this can lead to unintended PHP execution of non-.php files (potential RCE depending on deployment). Version 2.11.1 fixes the issue.",
