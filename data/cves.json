The first vulnerability is a reflected XSS that occurs in the news comment functionality when authenticated users interact with the comment form. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the URL parameter that gets executed when users click outside the comment field after typing content. The second vulnerability involves an upload restriction bypass for authenticated administrators, allowing them to upload SVG files containing malicious code through the media manager's remote URL upload feature. This results in stored XSS when the uploaded SVG files are accessed. These vulnerabilities were discovered by Hubert Wojciechowski and affect the news.php and image.php components of the CMS.",

      "description": "e107 CMS version 3.2.1 contains a critical file upload vulnerability that allows authenticated administrators to override arbitrary server files through path traversal. The vulnerability exists in the Media Manager's remote URL upload functionality (image.php) where the upload_caption parameter is not properly sanitized. An attacker with administrative privileges can use directory traversal sequences (../../../) in the upload_caption field to overwrite critical system files outside the intended upload directory. This can lead to complete compromise of the web application by overwriting configuration files, executable scripts, or other critical system components. The vulnerability was discovered by Hubert Wojciechowski and affects the image.php component in the admin interface.",
