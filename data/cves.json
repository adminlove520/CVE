      "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in HDF5 up to 1.14.6. Affected by this issue is the function H5F_addr_encode_len of the file src/H5Fint.c. The manipulation of the argument pp leads to heap-based buffer overflow. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

      "description": "A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Netis WF-2404 1.1.124EN. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the component BusyBox Shell. The manipulation leads to cleartext storage of sensitive information. It is possible to launch the attack on the physical device. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
