      "description": "A weakness has been identified in SimStudioAI sim up to ed9b9ad83f1a7c61f4392787fb51837d34eeb0af. Affected by this issue is the function Import of the file apps/sim/app/api/files/upload/route.ts of the component HTML File Parser. Executing manipulation of the argument File can lead to unrestricted upload. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be exploited. This product operates on a rolling release basis, ensuring continuous delivery. Consequently, there are no version details for either affected or updated releases. This patch is called 45372aece5e05e04b417442417416a52e90ba174. A patch should be applied to remediate this issue.",
