For the attack to succeed, the attacker needs a user account in Graylog. They can then proceed to issue hand-crafted requests to the Graylog REST API and exploit a weak permission check for token creation. This issue has been patched in versions 6.2.4 and 6.3.0-rc.2. A workaround involves disabling the respective configuration found in System > Configuration > Users > \"Allow users to create personal access tokens\".",
