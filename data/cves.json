In version 0.23.1 and possibly earlier versions, the MinerU parser contains a \"Zip Slip\" vulnerability, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the server (leading to Remote Code Execution) via a malicious ZIP archive. The MinerUParser class retrieves and extracts ZIP files from an external source (mineru_server_url). The extraction logic in `_extract_zip_no_root` fails to sanitize filenames within the ZIP archive.

      "description": "PHPUnit is a testing framework for PHP. A vulnerability has been discovered in versions prior to 12.5.8, 11.5.50, 10.5.62, 9.6.33, and 8.5.52 involving unsafe deserialization of code coverage data in PHPT test execution. The vulnerability exists in the `cleanupForCoverage()` method, which deserializes code coverage files without validation, potentially allowing remote code execution if malicious `.coverage` files are present prior to the execution of the PHPT test. The vulnerability occurs when a `.coverage` file, which should not exist before test execution, is deserialized without the `allowed_classes` parameter restriction. An attacker with local file write access can place a malicious serialized object with a `__wakeup()` method into the file system, leading to arbitrary code execution during test runs with code coverage instrumentation enabled. This vulnerability requires local file write access to the location where PHPUnit stores or expects code coverage files for PHPT tests. This can occur through CI/CD pipeline attacks, the local development environment, and/or compromised dependencies. Rather than just silently sanitizing the input via `['allowed_classes' => false]`, the maintainer has chosen to make the anomalous state explicit by treating pre-existing `.coverage` files for PHPT tests as an error condition. Starting in versions  in versions 12.5.8, 11.5.50, 10.5.62, 9.6.33, when a `.coverage` file is detected for a PHPT test prior to execution, PHPUnit will emit a clear error message identifying the anomalous state. Organizations can reduce the effective risk of this vulnerability through proper CI/CD configuration, including ephemeral runners, code review enforcement, branch protection, artifact isolation, and access control.",

Prior to versions 1.8.7, 1.7.7, and 1.6.3, a bug was found with authentication checks on the `GetConfig()` API endpoint. This allowed unauthenticated users to access this endpoint by specifying an `Authorization` header with any non-empty `Bearer` token value, regardless of validity.  This vulnerability did allow for exfiltration of configuration data such as endpoints for connected Argo CD clusters. This data could allow an attacker to enumerate cluster URLs and namespaces for use in subsequent attacks. Additionally, the same bug affected the `RefreshResource` endpoint. This endpoint does not lead to any information disclosure, but could be used by an unauthenticated attacker to perform a denial-of-service style attack against the Kargo API. `RefreshResource` sets an annotation on specific Kubernetes resources to trigger reconciliations. If run on a constant loop, this could also slow down legitimate requests to the Kubernetes API server. This problem has been patched in Kargo versiosn 1.8.7, 1.7.7, and 1.6.3. There are no workarounds for this issue.",

      "description": "Dozzle is a realtime log viewer for docker containers. Prior to version 9.0.3, a flaw in Dozzle’s agent-backed shell endpoints allows a user restricted by label filters (for example, `label=env=dev`) to obtain an interactive root shell in out‑of‑scope containers (for example, `env=prod`) on the same agent host by directly targeting their container IDs. Version 9.0.3 contains a patch for the issue.",
