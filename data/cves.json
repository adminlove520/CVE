An attacker can use the interface to exfiltrate PINs. As the devices are explicitly built as Plug-and-Play to be easily replaced, an attacker is easily able to remove the device, install a hardware implant which connects to the UART and exfiltrates the data exposed via UART to another system (e.g. via WiFi).",

In this new hardware revision it was noticed that an SSH service is exposed on port 22. By analyzing the firmware of the devices, it was noticed that there are two users with hardcoded and weak passwords that can be used to access the devices via SSH. The passwords can be also guessed very easily. The password of at least one user is set to a random value after the first deployment, with the restriction that the password is only randomized if the configured date is prior to 2022. Therefore, under certain circumstances, the passwords are not randomized. For example, if the clock is never set on the device, the battery of the clock module has been changed, the Access Manager has been factory reset and has not received a time yet.",

The configuration is done in a graphical user interface on the dormakaba exos server.

The SOAP request is sent without any prior authentication or authorization by default. Though authentication and authorization can be configured using IPsec for 92xx-K5 devices and mTLS for 92xx-K7 devices, it is not enabled by default and must therefore be activated with additional steps.\n\nThis insecure default allows an attacker with network level access to completely control the whole environment. An attacker is for example easily able to conduct the following tasks without prior authentication:\n- Re-configure Access Managers (e.g. remove alarming system requirements)\n- Freely re-configure the inputs and outputs\n- Open all connected doors permanently\n- Open all doors for a defined time interval\n- Change the admin password\n- and many more\n\nNetwork level access can be gained due to an insufficient network segmentation as well as missing LAN firewalls. Devices with an insecure configuration have been identified to be directly exposed to the internet.",
