      "description": "A vulnerability was found in Tomofun Furbo 360 and Furbo Mini. The affected element is an unknown function of the component Root Account Handler. Performing manipulation results in use of hard-coded password. The attack must be initiated from a local position. The attack is considered to have high complexity. The exploitability is described as difficult. The exploit has been made public and could be used. The firmware versions determined to be affected are Furbo 360 up to FB0035_FW_036 and Furbo Mini up to MC0020_FW_074. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
