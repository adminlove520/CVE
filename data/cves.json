      "description": "EspoCRM is an open source customer relationship management application. In versions before 9.1.9, a vulnerability allows arbitrary user creation, including administrative accounts, through a combination of stored SVG injection and lack of CSRF protection. An attacker with Knowledge Base edit permissions can embed a malicious SVG element containing a link in the body field of an article. When an authenticated user clicks the malicious link, they are redirected to an attacker-controlled HTML page that executes a CSRF request against the api/v1/User endpoint. If the victim is prompted for and enters their credentials, an attacker-controlled account is created with privileges determined by the CSRF payload. This issue has been patched in version 9.1.9.",

The vulnerability arises from the use of a shared cache directory instead of a user-specific one, making it susceptible to local data tampering and denial of service.",
