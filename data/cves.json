      "description": "ESPHome is a system to control microcontrollers remotely through Home Automation systems. In version 2025.8.0 in the ESP-IDF platform, ESPHome's web_server authentication check can pass incorrectly when the client-supplied base64-encoded Authorization value is empty or is a substring of the correct value. This allows access to web_server functionality (including OTA, if enabled) without knowing any information about the correct username or password. This issue has been patched in version 2025.8.1.",

      "description": "tracing is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect structured, event-based diagnostic information. Prior to version 0.3.20, tracing-subscriber was vulnerable to ANSI escape sequence injection attacks. Untrusted user input containing ANSI escape sequences could be injected into terminal output when logged, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate terminal title bars, clear screens or modify terminal display, and potentially mislead users through terminal manipulation. tracing-subscriber version 0.3.20 fixes this vulnerability by escaping ANSI control characters when writing events to destinations that may be printed to the terminal. A workaround involves avoiding printing logs to terminal emulators without escaping ANSI control sequences.",
