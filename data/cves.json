The exploit is publicly available and might be used. Upgrading to version 2.3.13 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The vendor explains: \"[T]he firmware does store a default password of 'admin'. This password has been deprecated since LT500E firmware version 2.3.13 and is no longer used. The LT500E does not have an administrator password set by default; a new password (at least 8 characters ) must be manually created upon first login the web management page.\"",
