A specially crafted event_id can result in paths outside the intended directory, potentially allowing file overwrite or creation in arbitrary locations. Submitting such input requires access to a valid DSN, potentially exposing them. If Bugsink runs in a container, the effect is confined to the container’s filesystem. In non-containerized setups, the overwrite may affect other parts of the system accessible to that user. This is fixed in versions 1.4.3, 1.5.5, 1.6.4 and 1.7.4.",
