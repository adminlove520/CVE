Prior to version 6.4.11 any user with the capability `manage customizations` can execute commands on the underlying infrastructure where OpenCTI is hosted and can access internal server side secrets by misusing the web-hooks. Since the malicious user gets a root shell inside a container this opens up the the infrastructure environment for further attacks and exposures. Version 6.4.11 fixes the issue.",
