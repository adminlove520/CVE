      "description": "OliveTin gives access to predefined shell commands from a web interface. In versions up to and including 3000.10.0, OliveTin's shell mode safety check (`checkShellArgumentSafety`) blocks several dangerous argument types but not `password`. A user supplying a `password`-typed argument can inject shell metacharacters that execute arbitrary OS commands. A second independent vector allows unauthenticated RCE via webhook-extracted JSON values that skip type safety checks entirely before reaching `sh -c`. When exploiting vector 1, any authenticated user (registration enabled by default, `authType: none` by default) can execute arbitrary OS commands on the OliveTin host with the permissions of the OliveTin process. When exploiting vector 2, an unauthenticated attacker can achieve the same if the instance receives webhooks from external sources, which is a primary OliveTin use case. When an attacker exploits both vectors, this results in unauthenticated RCE on any OliveTin instance using Shell mode with webhook-triggered actions. As of time of publication, a patched version is not available.",

      "description": "Bugsink is a self-hosted error tracking tool. In versions prior to 2.0.13, an unauthenticated attacker who can submit events to a Bugsink project can store arbitrary JavaScript in an event. The payload executes only if a user explicitly views the affected Stacktrace in the web UI. When Pygments returns more lines than it was given (a known upstream quirk that triggers with Ruby heredoc-style input), `_pygmentize_lines()` in `theme/templatetags/issues.py:75-77` falls back to returning the raw input lines. `mark_safe()` at line 111-113 is then applied unconditionally - including to those unsanitized raw lines. Since DSN endpoints are public by Sentry protocol, no account is needed to inject. The payload sits in the database until an admin looks at the event. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker to be able to submit events to the project (i.e. knows the DSN or can access a client that uses it), the Bugsink ingest endpoint is reachable to the attacker, and an administrator explicitly views the crafted event in the UI. Under those conditions, the attacker can execute JavaScript in the administrator’s browser and act with that user’s privileges within Bugsink. Version 2.0.13 fixes the vulnerability.",

      "description": "Repostat is a React component to fetch and display GitHub repository info. Prior to version 1.0.1, the `RepoCard` component is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability occurs because the component uses React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render the repository name (`repo` prop) during the loading state without any sanitization. If a developer using this package passes unvalidated user input directly into the `repo` prop (for example, reading it from a URL query parameter), an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser. In version 1.0.1, the use of dangerouslySetInnerHTML has been removed, and the repo prop is now safely rendered using standard React JSX data binding, which automatically escapes HTML entities.",

      "description": "InvenTree is an Open Source Inventory Management System. Prior to version 1.2.3, insecure server-side templates can be hijacked to expose secure information to the client. When generating custom batch codes, the InvenTree server makes use of a customizable jinja2 template, which can be modified by a staff user to exfiltrate sensitive information or perform code execution on the server. This issue requires access by a user with granted staff permissions, followed by a request to generate a custom batch code via the API. Once the template has been modified in a malicious manner, the API call to generate a new batch code could be made by other users, and the template code will be executed with their user context. The code has been patched to ensure that all template generation is performed within a secure sandboxed context. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.3, and any versions from 1.3.0 onwards. Some workarounds are available. The batch code template is a configurable global setting which can be adjusted via any user with staff access. To prevent this setting from being edited, it can be overridden at a system level to a default value, preventing it from being edited. This requires system administrator access, and cannot be changed from the client side once the server is running. It is recommended that for InvenTree installations prior to 1.2.3 the `STOCK_BATCH_CODE_TEMPLATE` and `PART_NAME_FORMAT` global settings are overridden at the system level to prevent editing.",

      "description": "OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management application. Versions prior to 8.0.0 have an information disclosure vulnerability that leaks the entire contact information for all users, organizations, and patients in the system to anyone who has the system/(Group,Patient,*).$export operation and system/Location.read capabilities.  This vulnerability will impact OpenEMR versions since 2023. This disclosure will only occur in extremely high trust environments as it requires using a confidential client with secure key exchange that requires an administrator to enable and grant permission before the app can even be used. This will typically only occur in server-server communication across trusted clients that already have established legal agreements. Version 8.0.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, disable clients that have the vulnerable scopes and only allow clients that do not have the system/Location.read scope until a fix has been deployed.",

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the file upload module of TypiCMS prior to version 16.1.7. The application allows users with file upload permissions to upload SVG files. While there is a MIME type validation, the content of the SVG file is not sanitized. An attacker can upload a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code. When another user (such as an administrator) views or accesses this file through the application, the script executes in their browser, leading to a compromise of that user's session. The issue is exacerbated by a bug in the SVG parsing logic, which can cause a 500 error if the uploaded SVG does not contain a `viewBox` attribute. However, this does not mitigate the XSS vulnerability, as an attacker can easily include a valid `viewBox` attribute in their malicious payload. Version 16.1.7 of TypiCMS Core fixes the issue.",

In versions 7.3.0-alpha.42 through 9.0.0-alpha.7, the `ConfigKeyCache` uses the same cache key for both master key and read-only master key when resolving function-typed keys. Under specific timing conditions, a read-only user can receive the cached full master key, or a regular user can receive the cached read-only master key. The fix in version 9.0.0-alpha.8 uses distinct cache keys for master key and read-only master key. As a workaround, avoid using function-typed master keys, or remove the `agent` configuration block from your dashboard configuration.",

Versions prior to 2.80.0, 3.30.0, and 4.59.0 of the Rollup module bundler (specifically v4.x and present in current source) is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write via Path Traversal. Insecure file name sanitization in the core engine allows an attacker to control output filenames (e.g., via CLI named inputs, manual chunk aliases, or malicious plugins) and use traversal sequences (`../`) to overwrite files anywhere on the host filesystem that the build process has permissions for. This can lead to persistent Remote Code Execution (RCE) by overwriting critical system or user configuration files. Versions 2.80.0, 3.30.0, and 4.59.0 contain a patch for the issue.",
