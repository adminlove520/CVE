      "description": "DeepChat is a smart assistant that connects powerful AI to your personal world.  DeepChat before 0.3.1 has a one-click remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by embedding a specially crafted deepchat: URL on any website, including a malicious one they control. When a victim visits such a site or clicks on the link, the browser triggers the app’s custom URL handler (deepchat:), causing the DeepChat application to launch and process the URL, leading to remote code execution on the victim’s machine. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.3.1.",

      "description": "Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites. In versions of astro before 5.13.2 and 4.16.18, the image optimization endpoint in projects deployed with on-demand rendering allows images from unauthorized third-party domains to be served. On-demand rendered sites built with Astro include an /_image endpoint which returns optimized versions of images. A bug in impacted versions of astro allows an attacker to bypass the third-party domain restrictions by using a protocol-relative URL as the image source, e.g. /_image?href=//example.com/image.png. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.13.2 and 4.16.18.",
