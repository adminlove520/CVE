      "description": "conda-forge infrastructure holds common configurations and settings for key pieces of the conda-forge infrastructure.\nBetween 2025-02-10 and 2025-04-01, conda-forge infrastructure used the wrong token for Azure's cf-staging access. This bug meant that any feedstock maintainer could upload a package to the conda-forge channel, bypassing our feedstock-token + upload process. The security logs on anaconda.org were check for any packages that were not copied from the cf-staging to the conda-forge channel and none were found.",
