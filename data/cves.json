Executing manipulation of the argument cmd can lead to path traversal. The attack can be launched remotely. Upgrading to version 2025.3.1.923 is recommended to address this issue. The affected component should be upgraded. R7-Office is a fork of OpenOffice and at the moment it remains unclear if OpenOffice is affected as well. The OpenOffice team was not able to reproduce the issue in their codebase. The vendor replied: \"We confirm that this vulnerability has been verified and patched in release 2025.3.1.923. During our security testing, it was not possible to exploit the issue - the server consistently returns proper error responses to the provided scenarios.\"",
