This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /admin/indexConfigs/save of the component Backend. The manipulation of the argument categoryName leads to cross site scripting. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product does not use versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable. Other parameters might be affected as well.
