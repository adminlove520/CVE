      "description": "The Zarinpal Gateway for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Improper Access Control to Payment Status Update in all versions up to and including 5.0.16. This is due to the payment callback handler 'Return_from_ZarinPal_Gateway' failing to validate that the authority token provided in the callback URL belongs to the specific order being marked as paid. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to potentially mark orders as paid without proper payment by reusing a valid authority token from a different transaction of the same amount.",

      "description": "The Forminator Forms – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the form_name parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.50.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The plugin allows admins to give form management permissions to lower level users, which could make this exploitable by users such as subscribers.",
