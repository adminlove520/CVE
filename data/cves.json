      "description": "Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to version 2.2.18, Rack::QueryParser enforces its params_limit only for parameters separated by &, while still splitting on both & and ;. As a result, attackers could use ; separators to bypass the parameter count limit and submit more parameters than intended. Applications or middleware that directly invoke Rack::QueryParser with its default configuration (no explicit delimiter) could be exposed to increased CPU and memory consumption. This can be abused as a limited denial-of-service vector. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.18.",

      "description": "git-commiters is a Node.js function module providing committers stats for their git repository. Prior to version 0.1.2, there is a command injection vulnerability in git-commiters. This vulnerability manifests with the library's primary exported API: gitCommiters(options, callback) which allows specifying options such as cwd for current working directory and revisionRange as a revision pointer, such as HEAD. However, the library does not sanitize for user input or practice secure process execution API to separate commands from their arguments and as such, uncontrolled user input is concatenated into command execution.
