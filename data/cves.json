This affects an unknown function of the file /delete.php of the component Product Inventory Handler. This manipulation of the argument product_code causes sql injection. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been published and may be used. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
