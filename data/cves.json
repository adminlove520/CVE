      "description": "CKAN is an open-source DMS (data management system) for powering data hubs and data portals. Prior to 2.10.9 and 2.11.4, the helpers.markdown_extract() function did not perform sufficient sanitization of input data before wrapping in an HTML literal element. This helper is used to render user-provided data on dataset, resource, organization or group pages (plus any page provided by an extension that used that helper function), leading to a potential XSS vector. This vulnerability has been fixed in CKAN 2.10.9 and 2.11.4.",

      "description": "In Search Guard FLX versions 3.1.1 and earlier, Field-Level Security (FLS) rules are improperly enforced on object-valued fields.\n\n\nWhen an FLS exclusion rule (e.g., ~field) is applied to a field which contains an object as its value, the object is correctly removed from the _source returned by search operations. However, the object members (i.e., child attributes) remain accessible to search queries. This exposure allows adversaries to infer or reconstruct the original contents of the excluded object.\n\n\n\n\nWorkaround - If you cannot upgrade immediately and FLS exclusion rules are used for object valued attributes (like ~object), add an additional exclusion rule for the members of the object (like ~object.*).",
