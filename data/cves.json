      "description": "A vulnerability was found in TRENDnet TN-200 1.02b02. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component Lighttpd. The manipulation of the argument secdownload.secret with the input neV3rUseMe leads to use of hard-coded cryptographic key\r . The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
