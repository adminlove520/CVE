      "description": "The Archify application contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability due to insufficient client validation in its privileged helper tool, com.oct4pie.archifyhelper, which is exposed via XPC. Archify follows the \"factored applications\" model, delegating privileged operations—such as arbitrary file deletion and file permission changes—to this helper running as root. However, the helper does not verify the code signature, entitlements, or signing flags of the connecting client. Although macOS provides secure validation mechanisms like auditToken, these are not implemented. As a result, any local process can establish a connection to the helper and invoke privileged functionality, leading to unauthorized execution of actions with root-level privileges.",

      "description": "A vulnerability in the K7RKScan.sys driver, part of the K7 Security Anti-Malware suite, allows a local low-privilege user to send crafted IOCTL requests to terminate a wide range of processes running with administrative or system-level privileges, with the exception of those inherently protected by the operating system. This flaw stems from missing access control in the driver's IOCTL handler, enabling unprivileged users to perform privileged actions in kernel space. Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service by disrupting critical services or privileged applications.",

      "description": "The macOS Rocket.Chat application is affected by a vulnerability that allows bypassing  Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) policies, enabling the exploitation or abuse of permissions specified in its entitlements (e.g., microphone, camera, automation, network client). Since Rocket.Chat was not signed with the Hardened Runtime nor set to enforce Library Validation, it is vulnerable to DYLIB injection attacks, which can lead to unauthorized actions or escalation of permissions. Consequently, an attacker gains capabilities that are not permitted by default under the Sandbox and its application profile.",
