      "description": "z2d is a pure Zig 2D graphics library. In version 0.6.0, when writing from one surface to another using `z2d.compositor.StrideCompositor.run`, the source surface can be completely out-of-bounds on the x-axis (but not on the y-axis) by way of a negative offset. This results in an overflow of the value controlling the length of the stride. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with `ReleaseFast` or `ReleaseSmall`), this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption. This issue is patched in version 0.6.1.",
