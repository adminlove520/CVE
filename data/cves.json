From version 5.49.0 to before 5.104.0, when experiments.buildHttp is enabled, webpack’s HTTP(S) resolver (HttpUriPlugin) enforces allowedUris only for the initial URL, but does not re-validate allowedUris after following HTTP 30x redirects. As a result, an import that appears restricted to a trusted allow-list can be redirected to HTTP(S) URLs outside the allow-list. This is a policy/allow-list bypass that enables build-time SSRF behavior (requests from the build machine to internal-only endpoints, depending on network access) and untrusted content inclusion in build outputs (redirected content is treated as module source and bundled).

      "description": "AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.32, there is a DoS vulnerability in ReadRSSFeedBlock. In RSSBlock, feedparser.parser is called to obtain the XML file according to the URL input by the user, parse the XML, and finally obtain the parsed result. However, during the parsing process, there is no limit on the parsing time and the resources that can be allocated for parsing. When a malicious user lets RSSBlock parse a carefully constructed, deep XML, it will cause memory resources to be exhausted, eventually causing DoS. This issue has been patched in autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.32.",
