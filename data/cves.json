      "description": "A vulnerability exists in Issuetrak v17.2.2 and prior that allows a low-privileged user to access audit results of other users by exploiting an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the Issuetrak audit component. The vulnerability enables unauthorized access to sensitive information, including user details, network and hardware information, installed programs, running processes, drives, and printers. Due to improper access controls, an attacker can retrieve audit data belonging to other users, potentially leading to unauthorized data exposure, privacy violations, and security risks.",

      "description": "The Appointment Booking Calendar — Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.8.5. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.",
