      "description": "The CSV to SortTable plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'csv' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

      "description": "A vulnerability was discovered in Awesome Miner thru 11.2.4 that allows arbitrary read and write to kernel memory and MSRs (such as LSTAR) as an unprivileged user. This is due to the implementation of an insecure version of WinRing0 (1.2.0.5, renamed to IntelliBreeze.Maintenance.Service.sys) that lacks a properly secured DACL, allowing unprivileged users to interact with the driver and, as a result, the kernel. This can result in local privilege escalation, information disclosure, denial of service, and other unspecified impacts.",
