      "description": "A client-side remote code execution vulnerability exists in Hanwha Techwin SSM (Samsung Security Manager) versions 1.32 and 1.4, due to improper restrictions on the PUT method exposed by the bundled Apache ActiveMQ instance (running on port 8161). An attacker can exploit this flaw through a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) bypass combined with JavaScript-triggered file uploads to the web server, ultimately resulting in arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. \n\nThis vulnerability bypasses the server-side mitigations introduced in ZDI-15-156 and ZDI-16-481 by shifting the exploitation to the client-side. \n\nThis product is now referred to as Hanwha Wisenet SSM and it is unknown if current versions are affected.",
