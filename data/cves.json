      "description": "A security vulnerability has been detected in yeqifu warehouse up to aaf29962ba407d22d991781de28796ee7b4670e4. Affected by this issue is the function addRole/updateRole/deleteRole of the file dataset\\repos\\warehouse\\src\\main\\java\\com\\yeqifu\\sys\\controller\\RoleController.java of the component Role Management Handler. Such manipulation leads to improper authorization. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed publicly and may be used. This product does not use versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable. The project was informed of the problem early through an issue report but has not responded yet.",
