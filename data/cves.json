      "description": "A vulnerability was found in Xuxueli xxl-job up to 3.1.1 and classified as problematic. Affected by this issue is the function makeToken of the file src/main/java/com/xxl/job/admin/controller/IndexController.java of the component Token Generation. The manipulation leads to password hash with insufficient computational effort. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
