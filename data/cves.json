      "description": "SpiceDB is an open source database for storing and querying fine-grained authorization data. Prior to version 1.44.2, on schemas involving arrows with caveats on the arrow’ed relation, when the path to resolve a CheckPermission request involves the evaluation of multiple caveated branches, requests may return a negative response when a positive response is expected. Version 1.44.2 fixes the issue. As a workaround, do not use caveats in the schema over an arrow’ed relation.",
