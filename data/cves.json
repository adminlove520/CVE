      "description": "ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. Versions 5.5.2-#187 and below allow an attacker to perform Blind SQL Injection through the add comment section within a channel. When adding a comment within a channel, there is a POST request to the /actions/ajax.php endpoint. The obj_id parameter within the POST request to /actions/ajax.php is then used within the user_exists function of the upload/includes/classes/user.class. php file as the $id parameter. It is then used within the count function of the upload/includes/classes/db.class. php file. The $id parameter is concatenated into the query without validation or sanitization, and a user-supplied input like 1' or 1=1-- - can be used to trigger the injection. This issue does not have a fix at the time of publication.",

In commits 55d4206c8 and prior, the n_discard parameter is parsed directly from JSON input in the llama.cpp server's completion endpoints without validation to ensure it's non-negative. When a negative value is supplied and the context fills up, llama_memory_seq_rm/add receives a reversed range and negative offset, causing out-of-bounds memory writes in the token evaluation loop. This deterministic memory corruption can crash the process or enable remote code execution (RCE). There is no fix at the time of publication.",
