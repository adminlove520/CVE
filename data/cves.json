      "description": "The CS5000 Fire Panel is vulnerable due to a hard-coded password that \nruns on a VNC server and is visible as a string in the binary \nresponsible for running VNC. This password cannot be altered, allowing \nanyone with knowledge of it to gain remote access to the panel. Such \naccess could enable an attacker to operate the panel remotely, \npotentially putting the fire panel into a non-functional state and \ncausing serious safety issues.",
