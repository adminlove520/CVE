      "description": "In Modem, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a heap buffer overflow. This could lead to remote escalation of privilege, if a UE has connected to a rogue base station controlled by the attacker, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: MOLY01672601; Issue ID: MSV-4623.",
