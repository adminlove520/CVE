      "description": "EVerest is an EV charging software stack. Prior to version 2025.10.0, an integer overflow occurring in `SdpPacket::parse_header()` allows the current buffer length to be set to 7 after a complete header of size 8 has been read. The remaining length to read is computed using the current length subtracted by the header length which results in a negative value. This value is then interpreted as `SIZE_MAX` (or slightly less) because the expected type of the argument is `size_t`. Depending on whether the server is plain TCP or TLS, this leads to either an infinite loop or a stack buffer overflow. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue.",

      "description": "EVerest is an EV charging software stack. Prior to version 2025.10.0, once the module receives a SDP request, it creates a whole new set of objects like `Session`, `IConnection` which open new TCP socket for the ISO15118-20 communications and registers callbacks for the created file descriptor, without closing and destroying the previous ones. Previous `Session` is not saved and the usage of an `unique_ptr` is lost, destroying connection data. Latter, if the used socket and therefore file descriptor is not the last one, it will lead to a null pointer dereference. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue.",
