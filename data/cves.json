This vulnerability occurs because the system uses a fixed, immutable key for encryption instead of dynamically generating or securely configuring the key. Attackers may obtain this key through reverse engineering or code analysis, potentially decrypting sensitive data or forging encrypted information, leading to information disclosure or unauthorized system access.\n\nThis issue affects Apache StreamPark: from 2.0.0 before 2.1.7.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.7, which fixes the issue.",

      "description": "The CleverDisplay BlueOne hardware player is designed with its USB interfaces physically enclosed and inaccessible under normal operating conditions. Researchers demonstrated that, after cicumventing the device’s protective enclosure, it was possible to connect a USB keyboard and press ESC during boot to access the BIOS setup interface. BIOS settings could be viewed but not modified. This behavior slightly increases the attack surface by exposing internal system information (CWE-1244) once the enclosure is removed, but does not allow integrity or availability compromise under standard or tested configurations.",
