      "description": "llama.cpp is an inference of several LLM models in C/C++. In commits 55d4206c8 and prior, the n_discard parameter is parsed directly from JSON input in the llama.cpp server's completion endpoints without validation to ensure it's non-negative. When a negative value is supplied and the context fills up, llama_memory_seq_rm/add receives a reversed range and negative offset, causing out-of-bounds memory writes in the token evaluation loop. This deterministic memory corruption can crash the process or enable remote code execution (RCE). There is no fix at the time of publication.",

      "description": "A vulnerability in the handling of verify_mode = CERT_REQUIRED in the wolfssl Python package (wolfssl-py) causes client certificate requirements to not be fully enforced. \n\nBecause the WOLFSSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT flag was not included, the behavior effectively matched CERT_OPTIONAL: a peer certificate was verified if presented, but connections were incorrectly authenticated when no client certificate was provided. \n\nThis results in improper authentication, allowing attackers to bypass mutual TLS (mTLS) client authentication by omitting a client certificate during the TLS handshake. \n\nThe issue affects versions up to and including 5.8.2.",
